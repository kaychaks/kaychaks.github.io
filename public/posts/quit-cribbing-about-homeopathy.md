I never understood why is there so much hate in West for Homeopathy. May be it cures via placebo, so what ? It boils down to whom do you trust more. Like the current US election race, it all depends on which bogus mainstream media's rants one trust.

In case of Homeopathy the choices are - bunch of medical scientists spending large sum of money to prove its fallacy or uncomfortable amount of people here in India who are still alive, because of these what many say "nothing but water", when their doctors of "modern/researched/approved medicine" have lost all hope (from personal experience(s))
