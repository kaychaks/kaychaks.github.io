**Argentina 2 - Nigeria 1**

It's a shame that Argentina is still in this tournament and Nigeria isn't. Nigerians were fast and passionate but lacked discipline in their passes. And their strikers could not convert simple one-on-one chances. But the Argentinians played even worse. Especially during later part of the second half. Apart from the beauty of Banega's pass to Messy for a much-awaited goal from the star, Argentina played like any World Cup debutant team. Their defence was fickle. And their ball control – much like their shots on goal – lost steam as the game progressed. Their next meeting is with a team who, much like them, have not played to their full potential – France. Hope both of them get serious and showcase some genuine football.
