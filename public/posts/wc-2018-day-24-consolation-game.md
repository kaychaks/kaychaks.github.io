## 3rd & 4th place game

**England 0 - Belgium 2**

Belgians came back with their inventive & creative gameplay. It was a treat to watch. England did not change much on playing boring football. It was fantastic watching Hazard & De Bruyne sweating & overcoming clueless English midfield & defence. Hazard, in particular, created more chances than out-of-form Lukaku could handle. Belgium in a way deserved more than the 3rd place. And England needs to find fun in their game to start with.
