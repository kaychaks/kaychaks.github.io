## Knockouts Day 2

Russia reaped the home advantage and this is turning out to be the world cup of penalties.

**Span 1 (3) - Russia 1 (4)**

Spanish complacency was ludicrous as they started without Iniesta – their main mastermind in front of a stubborn defence. It was a game that tested the patience of spectators. As the Spaniards passed the ball among each other, the Russians made sure they don't cross the borders of the penalty box. I consider the game to be a tactical win of Russians as they pretty much stuck to their plan of resistance. And the way Spain responded was – maintaining the possession of the ball for more than 70% of the whole 120 minutes but shooting the target less than 10 times! As they say, when it goes to penalties it's more luck than talent. And as was pretty evident during the normal time of the match Spain's luck was already homebound. Russia will face Croatia in the quarters who like the Russians also had to grind till the penalties.
