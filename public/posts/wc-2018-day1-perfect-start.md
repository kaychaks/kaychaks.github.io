**Russia 5 - Saudi Arabia 0**

The mood of this match was as casual as the ones of their leaders watching from behind the glass. Saudis were never interested in the game. They never shot on target during the first half and only a couple in the second. But, the _70,000 + 11_  Ruskies were enjoying the moment. It was a perfect start for the host nation. But they have a long way to go.
