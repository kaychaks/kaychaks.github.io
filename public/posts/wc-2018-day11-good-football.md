**England 6 - Panama 1**

England got a grip and showered good football. And also all those goals. Wish they continue the same momentum.

**Senegal 2 - Japan 2**

This was one of the best matches so far. Both the teams played a fast-paced and technically profound game. Senegal like last time proved they can maintain their stamina and passion for as long as they want. But Japan also levelled them â€“ first by coming back from behind for both of their goals and then by maintaining their attacking spirit till the end of the game. Japan might have it easy for their last match to progress to the next round. But Senegal would have to face a do-or-die with Columbia!
