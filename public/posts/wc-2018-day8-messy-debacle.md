Every World Cup few over-hyped teams underperform. It seems the number of such teams is the most this time.

**France 1 - Peru 0**

France is through to next round thanks to their second unconvincing win. Many considered them to be the team to watch out for this time. Many proclaimed them to be fast, young & skilful of all the big nations taking part in this World Cup. Alas, they showed none of that in their matches so far. Rather Peru was the dominating party during most of the time in this match. It would be interesting to see how far they can ride on their luck.

**Argentina 0 - Croatia 3**

Argentina had no such luck favouring them though. It's appalling to witness the demise of a team with a legend & legendary past. After suffering the first goal, Argentinian coach sent all his young & promising strikers to neutralise the situation. But the Croatian gameplay was astounding. They were aggressive, fast & relentless. They not only made Messi lose his skills with the ball but also his usual calm. It was a pity to see Maradona crumbling in the stands hoping some *hand of God* might save this Argentinian descent.
