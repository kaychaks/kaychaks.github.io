Projection and updates of nested data structure encoded as `Map<String, Object>` made elegant via Optics - not a big deal unless one needs to do that in Java. But FunctionalJavaâ€™s optics APIs saved my day again. The fact that FunctionalJava is so underused in the enterprise, which still lives in Java-land, is mind-boggling to me. I don't work in Java anymore but demoing the power of lawful optics via FunctionalJava library was interesting.
