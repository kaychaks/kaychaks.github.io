**Portugal 1 - Iran 1**

It's already _knockouts_ mindset with the teams. As this is the final week of group games and most of the groups have no clear toppers. Portugal had to draw and Iran had to win to stay alive. And as has been the character of this World Cup the game went to the wire. Iran played their best during the last 3 minutes of the additional time. They should have accelerated much earlier. Portugal will play Uruguay in the next round â€“ who played their best game against Russia earlier in the evening.
