**Portugal 1 - Morocco 0**

Is this the time for real Ronaldo to stand up and shine like Euro 2016? Or it's a matter of time till their luck runs out?

They had a similar start back in 2016 when they picked up steam very late. But, Ronaldo's impact is there both on the ball as well as on his teammates. Although they have serious issues to take care with ball possession, mid-field play and callous defence, an immense amount of uplifting energy flows through his mates as soon as Ronaldo make his run for the ball. We will have to wait to see how long will this living on the edge continue.
