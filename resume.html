<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I am passionate about programming from its mathematical to its industrial
aspects. My interests lies in Functional Programming, Knowledge Engineering, and
Decentralized Web. I am a self-learning, research-focused, and hands-on
programmer with experience in building sytems at both
server and client level. I’ve worked in R&amp;D organizations as well as
handled large Enterprise Client Delivery projects. My
idea of leadership is <em>show-and-tell</em> and less leadership more collaboration. I
value open-source culture and try to contribute to open-source projects on the side.</p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li>Designed and spearheading a large frontend techonology transformation initiative for one of the largest e-commerce web application. The web application is being transitioned from legacy technologies of Backbone / Marrionette to modern Vue3 and SSR based frontend stack.</li>
<li>The design is keeping in mind large number of existing vertical domains thereby implementation is being done in a pure domain-driven design model.</li>
<li>Design is trying to enable some flavours of micro-frontends so that disparate teams could go live without having hard dependencies on other teams</li>
<li>The overall design also entails creating a multi-theme design system from scratch (without relying on any external design frameworks)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sr.-architect---large-store-transformation-2019---2020">Sr. Architect - Large Store Transformation [2019 - 2020]</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Designed the end-to-end flow of an Hybrid Mobile Web Application destined to
provide one consolidated experience capturing features from more than 40
legacy applications</li>
<li>Designed &amp; implemented <em>GraphQL</em> based middleware providing sophisticated schema
for an <em>React/Relay</em> based Hybrid Web Application and also having totally
<em>type-safe Typescript</em> resolvers integrating with multiple
micro-services based Enterprise backends</li>
<li>Designed &amp; implemented a Google <em>Kubernetes</em> Engine based cloud-native
deployment pipeline that also interfaced with other Google Cloud services like
Stackdriver &amp; BigQuery for tracing and monitoring</li>
<li>Implemented various proof-of-concepts to migrate one of the critical native
store application from iOS to Android dealing with low level Secure Socket
Programming &amp; AES encrypted message passing via an adhoc wire protocol</li>
<li>Implemented advanced techniques in Relay’s runtime and network manager to deal
with better client performance with respect to lazy loading and automated
remote logging/monitoring.</li>

<hr />
<ul>
<li><p>Collaborated with academia for research engagements which entailed doing extensive literature study
(especially going through foundational research papers), evaluating relevant source code
libraries/implementations, and coming up with novel approaches to become a
research proposal.</p></li>
<li><p>Worked on a proposal for <em>Model-based Resiliency Validation of Cloud-Native
Distributed System</em> to come up with a stochastic model which can then be plugged
into a home-grown failure injection platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented a Haskell based solution leveraging Hidden Markov Models based probabilistic inferencing
algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>Involved in literature-study and proof-of-concepts of following other research
proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing dependent type theory to model and reason Description Logic-based Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning systems</li>

other innovative techniques involving logic programming (Datalog &amp;
mini-Kanren), rules-engines, &amp; other platforms (Stanford DeepDive) for various use-cases both internal
and customer specific.</p></li>
<li><p>Used Scala and Spark to do data analysis on the complete Stack Overflow Q&amp;A
dataset and created various Skills Clusters using Graph Algorithms. Which then was leveraged for an
home-grown Skills and Competencies Ontology &amp; related tool to help Human
Resources in talent supply chain.</p></li>
