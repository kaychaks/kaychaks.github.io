    <p>It will be again a European crown like last time.</p>
<p><strong>Uruguay 0 - France 2</strong></p>
<p>It was a game of tussle between Uruguayan desperation &amp; French persuasion. Without Cavani, the Uruguayan attack was like an already amputated man losing his last leg. Suarez tried his best to muster a number of chances. But none of his teammates had the vision or talent to work with them. France realised that &amp; made sure they don’t do anything silly on the back. French game had the same fluidity like last time. Mbappe showed some interesting skills both with his legs &amp; drama. However, I felt Uruguayans were not that bewildered by French defence. Which might be enough for Martinez’s jubilant men to easily triumph in the semis.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 1 - Belgium 2</strong></p>
<p>This was the best match of the tournament so far for me (many consider Belgium’s last match with Japan to be the best). It was a great night of football where teams played to their best with a worthy winner in the end. Brazil’s painstaking efforts to penetrate Belgium defence was a treat to watch. Also quite heartbreaking. Belgium’s superb tactic to make De Bruyne play from the centre with Lukaku in the flanks split wide open Brazilian defence. Lukaku was unstoppable &amp; Hazard was critical. But I would say the real hero of the match was Courtois. His gravity-defying saves took the match away from Brazil.</p>
<p>Tite’s plan to not start with Firmino again might be a bad move. He along with Costa made quite an impression in the second half. However, I felt Brazil lacks a physically strong attacking player who could withstand the pushing &amp; shoving to rush inside a stubborn defence. Current talents like Neymar &amp; Coutinho are too feeble to make their way in &amp; hence spend most of the time strolling around the penalty circle. Brazil also missed some straightforward chances which are a criminal offence in the World Cup. Brazil did not disappoint like last time. I wish they progress further next time in Qatar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am betting on Belgium as champions.</p>

<p>Sweeden &amp; Switzerland should be banned for playing the most boring game of the World Cup. And England narrowly missed <em>their exit</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Columbia 1 (3) - England 1 (4)</strong></p>
<p>Watching English players on the field is like watching a Twitch stream of someone playing the latest version of EA Sports’ FIFA. Their gameplay and style were so mechanical that it bored me to death. Columbians, on the other hand, showed exquisite legwork whenever they found time after doing those unnecessary pushing, shoving, and play-acting drama. The game was more of reality tv than a real sport. I pity the referee who should avoid travelling to South America anytime soon. England’s path till finals henceforth is easy (assuming Croatia don’t panic against Russia and then get beaten by the English luck). Also, their next game should be called off by sending Sweeden home for wasting the time of thousands of spectators with the most dreadful game of the tournament against Switzerland.</p>

<p>Brazilians behaved like monks and Belgians got exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Mexico 0 - Brazil 2</strong></p>
<p>This Brazil is a completely different team. They are composed, methodical, and introverted. But the most striking feature is the unusual calmness in their game. They controlled the flow of the entire game. The whole game appeared to follow a rhythm of sleepy progress, a sudden burst of energy, and quick settling back to the earlier state of nirvana. But the Selecaos never lost track of their main agenda ever. Neymar continued leveraging his rediscovered form from the last game. But the real star of this game was Wilson. He suddenly got woke in the second half and decided to do the work for everyone else. And he did deliver pretty well. In the end, it seemed the game got over a bit early. I was hoping for them to continue the wonderful legwork for some more time.</p>
<p>Brazil’s next challenge against the mighty Belgians would be their toughest. Last minute luck favoured Belgium against Japan but the game raised pressing questions on their invincibility. Hope Tete and his team are studying them well.</p>

<p>Russia reaped the home advantage and this is turning out to be the world cup of penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Span 1 (3) - Russia 1 (4)</strong></p>
<p>Spanish complacency was ludicrous as they started without Iniesta – their main mastermind in front of a stubborn defence. It was a game that tested the patience of spectators. As the Spaniards passed the ball among each other, the Russians made sure they don’t cross the borders of the penalty box. I consider the game to be a tactical win of Russians as they pretty much stuck to their plan of resistance. And the way Spain responded was – maintaining the possession of the ball for more than 70% of the whole 120 minutes but shooting the target less than 10 times! As they say, when it goes to penalties it’s more luck than talent. And as was pretty evident during the normal time of the match Spain’s luck was already homebound. Russia will face Croatia in the quarters who like the Russians also had to grind till the penalties.</p>

<p>As expected teams upped the ante as the knockouts begin. And hence the setbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Argentina 3 - France 4</strong></p>
<p>I earlier lamented on French football the way they played in the group games. After this game, I take some of my qualms back. It seems as if they deliberately created a fake perception around themselves. Thereby saving all their real talents for now when it matters the most. Mbappe’s sprints are like Ronaldo’s. It’s a breath of fresh air watching him run like a lightning towards the goal. Argentinian weak defence had no idea what to do with him. They never strategised how to tackle him. Which, as it is quite clear now, was the biggest mistake. Messy was helpless as the solid French defence surrounded him like hawks the moment he touched the ball. Overall the game was worthy of a knockout between 2 matured teams. It was fast-paced, there were some startling long distance shots, and – continuing the spirit of this World Cup– had some last minute drama.</p>
<p><strong>Portugal 1 - Uruguay 2</strong></p>
<p>Uruguayans, like the French, presented their unique proposition for the Cup with the way they played in this match. It was the game when Cavani resurged being one of Uruguay’s real stars. People should move away from Suarez. Ronaldo like Messi was caged by a more unbreakable defence. Portugal’s vulnerability with lack of attacking options was out in the open for Uruguayans to exploit. At one time it was appalling to watch Portugal’s attack being helpless &amp; failing to take a single shot at the goal. The best team won in this match as well and now both of these worthy winners will meet for, hopefully, a riveting quarterfinal.</p>

    <p><strong>Senegal 0 - Columbia 1</strong></p>
<p>Senegal is going home because of the wrong gameplan, and some bad luck. Their plan to play for a draw rarely works in World Cup. Only mature teams with a strong defence could pull that off. Senegal was deliberately downplaying their attacking abilities. Some discipline in earlier games might have saved their chances. But that’s no reason to play poor football. Columbians have to work hard on all fronts for their showoff with England. The final day of the group games was everyone playing safe and saving their energy for the knockouts. Let’s hope they don’t disappoint there.</p>

    <p><strong>Germany 0 - South Korea 2</strong></p>
<p>I must admit that I was shocked when the final whistle ended the depressing game. Not because of what the results meant but by the way the Germans approached the game. It had all the signs of being a pre-determined outcome. But let’s not dwell on controversies so early. Germany’s lack of dedication and no desire to win was clear from the get-go. They looked tired from the first half and their attempts at goals were callous. None of them showed any urgency during the final minutes as well. Germany had to work hard to fix the team dynamics and up-the-ante on their attack. It’s a bitter crash out and a sad ending.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 2 - Serbia 0</strong></p>
<p>Brazilians have got their groove back, finally. It was a joy watching Neymar active and pushing. And that old serendipitous style of pushing the ball up into the opponent’s half. There was some dullness in the second half though which the Serbs wanted to grasp but could not. Brazilians still need to work on ball possession and pass accuracy, especially in the midfield. Because with this form it will not be easy tackling the confident Mexicans in the knockouts.</p>

    <p><strong>Argentina 2 - Nigeria 1</strong></p>
<p>It’s a shame that Argentina is still in this tournament and Nigeria isn’t. Nigerians were fast and passionate but lacked discipline in their passes. And their strikers could not convert simple one-on-one chances. But the Argentinians played even worse. Especially during later part of the second half. Apart from the beauty of Banega’s pass to Messy for a much-awaited goal from the star, Argentina played like any World Cup debutant team. Their defence was fickle. And their ball control – much like their shots on goal – lost steam as the game progressed. Their next meeting is with a team who, much like them, have not played to their full potential – France. Hope both of them get serious and showcase some genuine football.</p>

<p>It’s already <em>knockouts</em> mindset with the teams. As this is the final week of group games and most of the groups have no clear toppers. Portugal had to draw and Iran had to win to stay alive. And as has been the character of this World Cup the game went to the wire. Iran played their best during the last 3 minutes of the additional time. They should have accelerated much earlier. Portugal will play Uruguay in the next round – who played their best game against Russia earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>England got a grip and showered good football. And also all those goals. Wish they continue the same momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Senegal 2 - Japan 2</strong></p>
<p>This was one of the best matches so far. Both the teams played a fast-paced and technically profound game. Senegal like last time proved they can maintain their stamina and passion for as long as they want. But Japan also levelled them – first by coming back from behind for both of their goals and then by maintaining their attacking spirit till the end of the game. Japan might have it easy for their last match to progress to the next round. But Senegal would have to face a do-or-die with Columbia!</p>
