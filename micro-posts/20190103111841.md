[Serverless Computing: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03651.pdf) is a remarkable assessment of the current "serverless computing" state of affairs or the lack of it. Moreover, it has some interesting research ideas/references towards the broader vision of "truly programmable & dynamic cloud computing".
