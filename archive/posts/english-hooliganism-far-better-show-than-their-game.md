I didn't see the match, coz it was a late broadcast here, but I read [it was a hodgepodge](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/england-russia-euro-2016-match-report) (usual for England in any big completion). However, I am half startled - half chuckled reading about the continuous nonsense being displayed by the stupid English fans(official word) against the Russians(who are not much different though).

This comment by an English MP, as [reported by Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/11/euro-2016-french-police-tactics-raise-fears-of-more-clashes-with-england-fans?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other), quite succinctly present the helplessness of this colorful English culture
