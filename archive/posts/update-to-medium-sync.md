Dave Winer's [title issue](https://medium.com/@davewiner/why-titles-in-medium-posts-via-ifttt-are-missing-70415ea5d98b) is resolved. Jamie at Medium [replied to Dave](https://medium.com/@majelbstoat/hi-dave-21aa3d48d569) proposing a change to the IFTTT recipe. The explanation from Jamie & [later clarification from Dave with the essential historical tid-bits](https://medium.com/@davewiner/getting-in-sync-with-medium-2f031077120d) on all the incarnations of having titles in blog posts was fun to read.

Now, I will appreciate some reply to my post on [other issues with IFTTT - Medium integration](https://medium.com/@kaychaks/questions-on-integration-with-medium-via-ifttt-bf75b2843c9e) that I wrote around the same time. Hey [Jamie](https://medium.com/u/4533cec1ea76), what do you have to say about them ?
