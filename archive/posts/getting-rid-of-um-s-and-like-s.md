I've the problem with "um" and everyone in *Enterprise World* around me has a severe problem with "like". Now being a rookie podcaster I could feel the lack of confidence of the speaker sprouting these nonsense every second which is irritating to any serious listener.

We all have to work around it and [Seth has some nice tips](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/06/um-and-like-and-being-heard.html) (emphasis mine)

> ... First on your own, eventually practicing with friends, replace the "um" with nothing. **With silence**.
