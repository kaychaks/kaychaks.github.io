Philip Wadler explained his seminal paper [Proposition as Types [PDF]](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf) on stage in StrangeLoop this year [with an once-in-a-lifetime act](https://youtu.be/IOiZatlZtGU?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R)

The whole presentation is mind-blowing. The way he peeled the layers to show the deep relationship between formal logic and modern computation through historical facts & proofs is a treat to watch.<sup id="fnref-1-2015-10-18"><a href="#fn-1-2015-10-18" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

I saw it more than once, mostly for the fun of it, & here are some of his statements (emphasis mine) that are still ringing in my ears. The notes are in reverse chronological order of the timeline of the presentation as I think some interesting point-of-views came out after the thing happened at around [33:24](https://youtu.be/IOiZatlZtGU?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&t=2004)

- 2 things that are wrong with computer science is *"computer" & "science"* coz its not just about computers and you don't put science in it if it's real science

- impact of computer science on knowledge in general
	- structuring of information is very important as it will not only help understanding how computers work or will work but also how universe is designed
	- how ideas are structure would determine that many new ideas can be discovered
	- <p>this is called informatics <sup id="fnref-2-2015-10-18"><a href="#fn-2-2015-10-18" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p> 

- *fundamental good idea takes 25-30 years for mass adoption*

- it takes a long time for good ideas to come out, so it needs a long perspective if you want to have good ideas, ideas that are discovered not invented

- logicians will always get there first than computer scientists to discover new ideas as they tend to be at there for a longer time

- lambda calculus is omniversal

- *real programming languages are discovered not invented*

- logicians and computer scientists come up with similar ideas pretty much at the same time i.e. *every good idea will be discovered twice*

- *central idea that relate logic to computability (curry/howard correspondence)*
	- proposition as types
	- proofs as programs
	- <p>simplification of proofs as evaluation of programs</p>

- Godel was 28, Turing was 23 when they undermine the work of Hilner( then 68) and Church( then 33) & Godel( then 30) respectively. So *young people should always call out when people older are wrong*.

- it all started with "Entscheidungsproblem" by Hilbert when he wanted Mathematicians to come up with an algorithm that can determine given a statement in formal logic whether that statement is true or false in other words he depended on the notion of complete logic which says that *every true statement is provable and every provable statement is true*
