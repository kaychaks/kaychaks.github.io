High scoring matches except the France - Ecuador one.

Argentina & Nigeria both played for goals and that's superb. And hence they produced the treat for us.

It was like tit for tat between Messi & Musa. When Messi was putting goals by being in right place at right time, Mussa was creating and delivering them. But it was the pace & vigor of the players that was really amazing to watch.

And the same happened for other matches. Switzerland scored heavily in the right match to qualify to the next round.

Best teams have gone ahead to the next round. It's the last day of the league round tomorrow with some exciting matches. And then it will be all eliminations.
