**Senegal 0 - Columbia 1**

Senegal is going home because of the wrong gameplan,  and some bad luck. Their plan to play for a draw rarely works in World Cup. Only mature teams with a strong defence could pull that off. Senegal was deliberately downplaying their attacking abilities. Some discipline in earlier games might have saved their chances. But that's no reason to play poor football. Columbians have to work hard on all fronts for their showoff with England. The final day of the group games was everyone playing safe and saving their energy for the knockouts. Let's hope they don't disappoint there.
