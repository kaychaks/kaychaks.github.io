**Germany 0 - South Korea 2**

I must admit that I was shocked when the final whistle ended the depressing game. Not because of what the results meant but by the way the Germans approached the game. It had all the signs of being a pre-determined outcome. But let's not dwell on controversies so early. Germany's lack of dedication and no desire to win was clear from the get-go. They looked tired from the first half and their attempts at goals were callous. None of them showed any urgency during the final minutes as well. Germany had to work hard to fix the team dynamics and up-the-ante on their attack. It's a bitter crash out and a sad ending.

**Brazil 2 - Serbia 0**

Brazilians have got their groove back, finally. It was a joy watching Neymar active and pushing. And that old serendipitous style of pushing the ball up into the opponent's half. There was some dullness in the second half though which the Serbs wanted to grasp but could not. Brazilians still need to work on ball possession and pass accuracy, especially in the midfield. Because with this form it will not be easy tackling the confident Mexicans in the knockouts.
