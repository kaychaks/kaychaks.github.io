Every World Cup few over hyped teams underperform. It seems number of such teams are maximum this time. 

**France 1 - Peru 0**

France are through to next round thanks to their second unconvincing win. France was considered to be the team to watch out for this time. They were proclaimed to be fast, young & skilful of all the big nations taking part in this World Cup. However, they showed none of that in their matches so far. Peru on the other hand was the dominating party during most of the time in this match. It would be interesting to see how far they can ride on their luck. 

**Aregentina 0 - Croatia 3**

Argentina on the other hand had no luck favouring them. It's appalling to witness the demise of a team with a legend & legendary past. After suffering the first goal Argentinian coach deployed all their young strikers (again considered lethal by most press) to neutralise the situation. But the Croatian gameplay was astounding. They were aggressive, fast & relentless. They not only made Messi loose his skills with the ball but also his usual calm. It was a pity to see Maradona crumbling in the stands hoping some *hand of God* might save this Argentinian descent.
