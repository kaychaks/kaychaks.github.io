**Russia 5 - Saudi Arabia 0**

The mood of this match was as casual as the ones of their leaders watching from behind the glass. Saudis were never interested in the game. They never shot on target during the first half and couple in the second. But, the 70,000 + 11 Ruskies were enjoying the moment. It was a perfect start for the host nation.
