_Oh you can't_

Gruber few days back [was praising Safari](https://daringfireball.net/2017/05/safari_vs_chrome_on_the_mac)

> Safari is Apple’s browser for Apple devices.

I think it should be

> Safari is Apple’s browser for Apple devices _to serve Apple's walled garden interests_.

The keynote is [available in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqHdULqet0) so every browser could play it, same keynote in [Apple's website](http://apple.co/2svxHNj) could be streamed in every browser **but** none of the [session videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2017/) could be streamed in any browser other than Apple's own Safari and they are not in YouTube. *Any guesses on why such discrepancy !*

In the [What's new in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/402/) session, presenters were talking on some new features geared towards server side Swift. Unfortunately, all those developers who are in Linux using Chrome thinking about using _open source_ Swift for their next system software or server side usage can't see / listen them.

There is always the option to download SD (min. size 400 MB) / HD (min. size 1.4 GB) videos of sessions, _am sure that'll be a really nice experience._

[Apple's support handle](https://twitter.com/AppleSupport) in Twitter is [confused](https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/876141756227751936) about it and developer forum is [mum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/237245#237245).
