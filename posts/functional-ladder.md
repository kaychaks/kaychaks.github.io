The LambdaConf guys came up with an [interesting way to group Functional Programmers](http://lambdaconf.us/downloads/documents/lambdaconf_slfp.pdf).

>LOFP is a standardised progression of different concepts and skills that developers must master on their journey to becoming expert-level functional programmers

Too bad it made many developers, especially in Twitter, go mad. It’s not *Politically Correct*  to call anyone by some kind of name these days, that was the biggest worry for most. People also said  - most of the stuffs mentioned are really hard, placed in wrong order, will take years to learn, and does not matter.

I don’t agree. To me the note is important for anyone who cares for *Functional Thinking* and want to have a deep understanding of the same. It has directions to what one should know at each step and how to put use of the same. People must realise - [It takes time to know something well](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SHt7f6BhFjIJ:norvig.com/21-days.html+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=safari).

However, I could think of one small thing to add - the instructions will make more sense for people who are fine with the idea of *Typed Functional Programming* (oh no!)
