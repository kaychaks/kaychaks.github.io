It will be again an European crown like last time. 

**Uruguay 0 - France 2**

It was a game of tussle between Uruguayan desperation & French persuasion. Without Cavani Uruguayan attack was like an already amputated man loosing his last leg. Suarez tried his best to muster number of chances. But none of his team mates had the vision or talent to work with them. France realised that & made sure they don't do anything silly on the back. French game had same fluidity like last time.  Mbappe showed some interesting skills both with his legs & drama. However, I felt Uruguayans were not that bewildered by French defence. Which might be enough for Martinez's jubilant men to easily triumph in the semis. 

**Brazil 1 - Belgium 2**

This was the best match of the tournament so far for me (many consider Belgium's last match with Japan to be the best). It was a great night of football where teams played to their best with a worthy winner in the end. Brazil's painstaking efforts to penetrate Belgium defence was a treat to watch. Also quite heartbreaking. Belgium's superb tactic to make De Bruyne play from centre with Lukaku in the flanks split wide open Brazilian defence. Lukaku was unstoppable & Hazard was critical. But I would say the real hero of the match was Courtois. His gravity defying saves took the match away from Brazil. 

Tite's plan to not start with Firmino again might be a bad move. He along with Costa made quite an impression in the second half. However,  I felt Brazil lacks a physically strong attacking player who could withstand the pushing & shoving to rush inside a stubborn defence. Current talents like Neymar & Coutinho are too feeble to make their way in & hence spend most of the time strolling around the penalty circle. Brazil also missed some straight forward chances which is a criminal offence in World Cup. Brazil did not disappoint like last time. I wish they progress further next time in Qatar. 

In the meantime I am betting on Belgium as champions.
