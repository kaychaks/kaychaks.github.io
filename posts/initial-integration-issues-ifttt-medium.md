Couple of questions on [kaushikc.org](kaushikc.org) to Medium via IFTTT

- How to have the tags associated with a post here to that in Medium. Ghost's RSS feed puts the tags in `<category>` section of the RSS XML. However, IFTTT action for Medium has no ingredient for the `feed-category`. May be it will come later as an update.

- Secondly how to get some nice typography features of Medium editor especially the Drop Caps one when someone submits a post using the publishing API (that IFTTT also uses behind the scenes) as HTML or Markdown ?
