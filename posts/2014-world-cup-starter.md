Brazil opened their starter with Croatia in an absolutely pathetic way. They won anyway, but it seemed the team consisted of bunch of confused kids forcefully put in front of a crowd. Scolari need to tighten the mid-field, left wing & back or else grown-up men from other European or neighborhood countries would have no problem ripping them apart.

Neymar need to hold on the ball to his feet much longer and have to reduce loosing it with shallow passes to opponents feet. And Hulk need to loosen up like his counterpart, Oscar, across the field. This Brazilian team is full of hope and ability but they lack a sense of direction and strategy.

The win was far from perfect for me and the team that won was not a world cup winning side.
