I am a believer of emails being the right choice for serious conversations (especially when its not live). It makes the writer to think. Todayâ€™s situations need, more than ever, ways to keep those conversations hidden *(from you know)*.  PGP is an old, open, and proven choice to get that. And I am a strong believer of the same as well.

However PGP has not got its right share of footing in the world yet. So it has remained as a mean of few (mostly Hackers & Nerds). That should change. For it to happen  people familiar with its highs and lows should talk, write and fight. Such conversations only can bring the right change both in thinking & doing.

Recently [Filippo wrote](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/12/op-ed-im-giving-up-on-pgp/) that Signal can replace PGP. And then Bruce Schenier [backed him](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/12/giving_up_on_pg.html). To me the thought sounded a bit strange. But the points raised against PGP are important to note and act upon. As a counter, [Walkfield wrote](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/signal-does-not-replace-pgp/) a fine piece backing PGP. All of these view points will only help and should happen often.

In the mean time, I will say that [Keybase](https://keybase.io) is doing their best to spread the love of PGP. [I am there](https://keybase.io/kaushikc). I hope others will join.
