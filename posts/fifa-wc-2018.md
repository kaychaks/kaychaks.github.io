I'll be journalling my reactions to the matches starting tomorrow like I did [4 years back](/tags/wc-2014.html). As its happening in Russia this time, most of the matches are during Indian evenings (few of them are late night). Which makes a nice after-work evening setup. But now I've got a [2-year-old](/posts/aarohi.html) which might make me watch fewer matches than I would want to. Nevertheless, I like to write my feelings every 4 years so I would try to catch one match every day (I hope !).

I have always been a supporter of _Seleção_ and yes I got [disappointed last time](/posts/the-desolation-world-cup-first-semifinal.html). It's not easy to change your darlings after years of emotional investment. I hope Brazil reach at least till quarters. But it does not matter as I like to write about the _beautiful game_ which is beyond a particular team.
