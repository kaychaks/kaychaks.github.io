## About me

I am passionate about programming from its mathematical to its industrial
aspects. My interests lies in Functional Programming, Knowledge Engineering, and
Decentralized Web. I am a self-learning, research-focused, and hands-on
programmer with experience in building sytems at both
server and client level. I've worked in R&D organizations as well as
handled large Enterprise Client Delivery projects. My
idea of leadership is _show-and-tell_ and less leadership more collaboration. I
value open-source culture and try to contribute to open-source projects on the side.

## Experience [Cognizant Technology Solutions, 2006 - NOW]

### Sr. Architect - Large Store Transformation [2019 - 2020]

---

- Designed the end-to-end flow of an Hybrid Mobile Web Application destined to
  provide one consolidated experience capturing features from more than 40
  legacy applications
- Designed & implemented _GraphQL_ based middleware providing sophisticated schema
  for an _React/Relay_ based Hybrid Web Application and also having totally
  _type-safe Typescript_ resolvers integrating with multiple
  micro-services based Enterprise backends
- Designed & implemented a Google _Kubernetes_ Engine based cloud-native
  deployment pipeline that also interfaced with other Google Cloud services like
  Stackdriver & BigQuery for tracing and monitoring
- Implemented various proof-of-concepts to migrate one of the critical native
  store application from iOS to Android dealing with low level Secure Socket
  Programming & AES encrypted message passing via an adhoc wire protocol
- Implemented advanced techniques in Relay's runtime and network manager to deal
  with better client performance with respect to lazy loading and automated
  remote logging/monitoring.

### Sr. Architect - Global Technology Office - Applied Research Initiatives [2018 - 2019]

---

- Collaborated with academia for research engagements which entailed doing extensive literature study
  (especially going through foundational research papers), evaluating relevant source code
  libraries/implementations, and coming up with novel approaches to become a
  research proposal.
- Worked on a proposal for _Model-based Resiliency Validation of Cloud-Native
  Distributed System_ to come up with a stochastic model which can then be plugged
  into a home-grown failure injection platform.
- Implemented a Haskell based solution leveraging Hidden Markov Models based probabilistic inferencing
  algorithms
- Involved in literature-study and proof-of-concepts of following other research
  proposals:

  - Bringing dependent type theory to model and reason Description Logic-based Knowledge
    Representation and Reasoning systems
  - Evaluating automatic Ontology generation approaches based on the foundations of Statistical
    Relational Learning
  - Evaluating proposal on using Fluid Session Types for various use cases

- Contributed to ScalaZ, an open source library in Scala for Typed Functional Programming

### Architect - Global Technology Office - Solutions and Accelerators [2012-2018]

---

- Worked on creating Knowledge Graph Models using Semantic Web Technologies (RDF
  & OWL) and
  other innovative techniques involving logic programming (Datalog &
  mini-Kanren), rules-engines, & other platforms (Stanford DeepDive) for various use-cases both internal
  and customer specific.
- Used Scala and Spark to do data analysis on the complete Stack Overflow Q&A
  dataset and created various Skills Clusters using Graph Algorithms. Which then was leveraged for an
  home-grown Skills and Competencies Ontology & related tool to help Human
  Resources in talent supply chain.
- Designed, setup, and maitained internal tools to improve developer
  productivity like source
  control repositories, CI/CD pipelines, docker registries for the overall company and deployed in a large
  Kubernetes cluster fully hosted in on-premise datacenters.
- Designed & implemented a generic Gamification Platform with rich analytical
  and presentation views. The technologies used were PHP, Angular, and Mongo DB
  for the client application and Drools as the central rules-engine driving the
  backend. Involved in pre-sales & evangelisation of the same for multiple
  customers.

- Contributed to HNix, an open source project for Haskell re-imlementation of
  the Nix expression language

### Sr. Associate - Global Technology Office - Consulting [2011 - 2012]

---

- Worked as lead consultant and developed features for the web dashboards of a
  large NY based Investment Bank's R&D division. Used extensively ExtJS widgets
  & a web-components based design that integrated with multiple other 3rd party
  scripts while ensuring strict performance requriements from customer.

- Worked as a consultant for a large mobility customer creating their massive
  web platform for converged experience of one of US's biggest media houses. The
  platform used advanced JavaScript to deliver streaming media content as well as lots of
  form based configuration screens having complicated business rules. Along with
  lead developer also tasked to manage teams across geographies for a seamless delivery.
  
### Associate [2006 - 2011]

---

- Developed an enterprise mashup platform which worked similar to Yahoo Pipes
  but produced deployable mashups. Used Adobe Flex as one of the technologies to
  create the platoform.
  
- Involved in a project to create web based knowledge management portal by one
  of the largest casual dining chain of US. Used a home-grown JavaScript framework which
  used copy-on-write techniques for performant user interfaces.

- Involved in a legacy modernisation project where one large restaurant chain
  were migrating from C++ based point-of-sale systems to .NET Framework.
  Migrated code from complex legacy C++ codebase to modern .Net v2
  implementations as part of a Windows CE native application to run in highly
  resource constrain registers. Had to consider critically both space and time complexities.

## Education
