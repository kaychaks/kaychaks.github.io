Justifying my godforsaken handwriting on those machine generated straight lines has always been a lost affair for me.

If it's all white, then it becomes more difficult as I get scared of all those spaces I see around. Firstly, it's the fear that my complete incompetency in any form of creative writing or drawing would destroy these pristine pages. And then, if also I could scribble something, I would want no white space in there to go wasted, eventually resulting in the same garbage that I was fearing in the first place.

So I stop, just after may be first two pages.

_I fear a lot about the outcome and never do the thing_

However, I've realised lately that this kind of fear mongering is mostly because of those exquisitely crafted notebooks. I have been noting down things on pieces of paper since long. And I do that pretty well on crap notebooks (ones which are from some conferences or available in the office stationary for free). I use it for all the essential tasks like taking minutes of the meeting, reminders, numbers, names & random ideas. And inessential stuffs like gibberish art (especially during a blank mind) or practice new way to sign my name (I am still not convinced of my signature).

I realized I'm a racist when I've choose my preferred paper to write. I don't have any problem to infuse junk on crap but I stutter as I am presented with some work-of-art.

Then there's this dilemma of using pen-paper for notes in the post-PC era. Well, that quibble got sorted out pretty quickly when I compared typing on touch keyboard to jotting down with a pen on a paper. It's simple & fast.

With mobiles, the neural workflow is kind of

- unlock the phone _(if it require your finger prints, then lots of other decision trees evolve - are your fingers moist, are you placing fingers perfectly vertical...)_
- decide the particular notes app for present scenario _(Is it going to be Drafts, Wunderlist, AnyList, Vesper or may be it should be a Calendar entry !!!)_
- once confirmed, open it up and adhere to it's own usability

With pen on paper,

- open the book
- start scribbling in the first space seemed vacant

I want to evolve from a discriminating lowlife to a pragmatic taskmaster. And for that I need to make myself care less for those beautiful notebooks. What an _irony!!_

Anyways, few days back I happened to come across Field Notes

![Field Notes Collection Image](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Drinklocal_6pack_sm.jpg)

Instantly, I knew I need them. And pretty quickly I realised that's gonna be a costly proposition for someone in the third-world asking for a cheap commodity from first-world. With all advancements in globalisation, trade, commerce & eventually technology in 2014 - it would take 7 times the actual cost to ship bunch of empty pieces of papers from affluence to negligence.

So, I started looking for local alternatives. Put a high bar on the overwhelming options so that they match the size & quality. My requirements were pretty simple

- small enough to carry around without the discomfort of it replacing a purse (yes I don't carry a purse, I've my [Slim](http://www.suprgood.com/collections/slim-wallet/products/slim-wallet-black))
- sturdy enough to withstand the tussle being in the pockets of an over-sized guy
- pages should be ruled or grid or a mix. White spaces are like too many options & hence confusing.
- should have aesthetics that can satiate my art tolerance

And eventually I locked down on [Rubberband Black Books](http://www.rubberbandproducts.com/shop/productdetail?q=24). They matched decently to my requirements.

I got them delivered few days back. Already feeling a bit sad that I have to write on them. Binding is a bit tight to what I was expecting and hence they don't open up that easily. However I feel that won't be a problem as I start using them. Well the problem might be to keep them closed when not in my pockets or in some enclosures. That's where band around my almost-never-used moleskin & those extra rubber bands for Field Notes comes handy.

![moleskin image](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Camera%20Uploads/2014-04-28%2022.04.14.jpg?_subject_uid=15382951&w=AAAum3C1IR2qnRbpvSxw1M5GYxUrcQVXKNVNAV38xGl4Qw)

These Black Books comes in a pair. Am planning to use onefor office and the other for personal. I will use the small grid in the bottom for tasks or lists. And horizontal rules for other kind of texts.

![Pair of black books](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Camera%20Uploads/2014-04-28%2020.18.29.jpg?_subject_uid=15382951&w=AAAB05LaByEvWOzwJPogx3JlQBmUz1mFbFurDZxeLSprgQ)

I would still have to fix another thing before starting using them. Is it gonna be a pencil or pen to write. I am currently using dad's recent gift of a Parker, it's smooth to write and I like mildly-thick bodied pens for easy gripping.

![parker pen image](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Camera%20Uploads/2014-04-30%2010.40.16.jpg?_subject_uid=15382951&w=AADLmdqsJo6DH5HmGIpSoXitbZEBlmAielNyEElcOS_KPQ)

However, pencils are always preferred for notebooks on account of their never ending editability feature. However, pen is a necessity most of the times where persistence is preferred. And carrying pencil means carrying a sharpner & erasure (or the whole point is meek) and taking care of the poking tip. So it'd be pencil if I have my bag or it would be my pen. In that way I am hoping most of my office notes would be in pencil and rest would be in pen.

I am ready, I think, for my notebooking expedition.

On the one hand we saw that brazilians know how to make grounds that can withstand harshest of showers during Mexico - Cameroon match. And on the other hand, we came to see a match that can very easily be termed as lyrical football.

Van Persie & Robben defied age & shown their class by mesmerizing spectators & the sport itself with their goal scoring abilities. I was much impressed with Robben as he is one of those players who know how to strive to reach the right place at the right time.

Holland made some mistakes in the first half but boy the way they played second half - flawless. Spain were not that bad but they had no option but to just fall infront of Dutch awesomeness.

Nothing is for certain how any of today's performances can turnaround anything going forward but one thing is for sure, Spainiards are mortal again.",

The Azzuris on the other hand were impecabble with their long ball controls & inpenetrable defence. But they are far from looking to be champions. That time will tell.

Now on the actual thing about teams who were not supposed to be winners. All sports analysts have kept their odds low. But they all scored quite heavily against their opponents (Columbia 3 agains Greece, Costa Rica 3 against Uruguay and Ivory Coast 2 agains Japan).

It signifies nothing as these are everyone's first matches. But of course it depicts one very clear message - clubs culture around the world has immensely helped guys from far off places learn the skills required to play international matches.

I watched the match just to see if Argentina can be safely assumed the cup contender from South America as Brazil was disappointing. But they all are playing safe.

France thrashed Honduras with Benzema all over them. They got so pissed off that one of them went out with a red. But again France did not play like champions. So, it's still Holland, from Europe, who are safely in that place, for now.",

In the end, Holland held on to their nerves and Dempay, the substitute, scored the winning goal.

Chile was aggressive, fast & full of trickeries for the old legs of Spain mid-field & defence. And when it came to offence, Spain lacked their typical precision & vigour.

But the highlight of the day - was England's exodus from yet another World Cup. Amidst all darkness, only ray of excitement for Brits was Rooney's first ball inside goal.

Suarez proved again why he is aggressively becoming one of the hottest forwards. With his field coverage, pace & presence of mind, he single handedly thrashed an already pathetic English defense.

England had the ball 60% of the time but could produce handful of real chances on the goal. Uruguay on the other hand made full use of their limited visits to English goalpost.

It seemed to be a shocker for Suarez who could not believe his historic acts. For me, what happened with England, was not much of a surprise.

It's an honor to see the same live while it happened and not as part of some highlight next day. It's one of those moments when you realize that like football in life only few moments actually matter coz rest of the time life sucks. Argentina slogged the whole time to make any dent into Iran's defense. And it took one breathtaking shot from Messi at 93rd minute to make all the rest 90 minutes effort worth the watch.

Then the Ghana's maverick game to put German hopes in order.

Ghana went down first then came back, then went ahead & made Germans put all of their extra ammunitions to come back. That's what a team having lesser known players but with determination, discipline & immense foot power can do to the best teams. Ghana has always been the star of Africa and hence they took the Germans head on. Not like other teams who play to frustrate & break-through rather attack & take chances.

And this is what has been the hallmark of this world cup that most of the weaker teams on paper are actually playing unbelievable game.",

Ronaldo could actually call himself the saviour with his scintillating pass, just 30 seconds remaining of the game. He would have to do much more than that in their last game against Ghana.

USA on the other side are much more formidable team than I expected them to be. It would be a shame if they don't make it to the next round.

Belgium, the true dark horse as many are contemplating, took almost the whole game to score just one goal against Russia. That does not mean they did not play well.

Brazil played their best game of the tournament against Cameroon. Cameroon being a soft target produced few rare scares & an equalizer as well. But then Brazil was all about their original samba style play of deft touches and dancing bodies all around.

Neymar, in particular, was especially dancing around the ground and was available everywhere. He was one time in the back guarding a player, snatching the ball, rocking the mid-field and then criss-crossing Cameroon defense. He scored two goals and both of them showed two different sides of his class - first his timing and second his Brazilian origin.

Brazil still need to patch their defense as more than once Cameroon's forwards breached into it. If they can do it then Chile, their opponent in next match, could also do it.

Coming to Chile, they also played against much worthy cup contender, Netherlands. The match resulted in a loss for them but it showed Netherland's lacklustreness without their star forward Van Persie. Robben was in his usual professional sprinter mode and produced a marvellous second goal. But overall, it was not the team that destroyed Spain.

Spain also consoled themselves with a win over Australia.

Uruguay needed a win, not like Italy who required a draw to move on, but they played like they knew it's not gonna happen. Most of the players looked fatigued much early in the game.

But the highlight of the day and the days to come was the incident when Suarez bit Chielleni. That was both hilarious and tragic.

In my opinion, no player is bigger than the game and hence he should get the worst possible sentence for it.

Football being a aggressive and highly energized game often taken as a all-is-fair-in-the-field kind of attitude. Time & again and in irony, game's best players happened to commit such unapologetic actions. And most of the times they don't get the right treatment coz the game would need it's stars.

Being a game of working class, it encourages bitterness in competition and unfairness in the course of the game. Very much like life. But it should be taken as sad mistakes, not as part of the gameplay.

England did massive replacements for their last match against Costa Rica. But failed to score.

In other matches, Greece moved to the next round, for the first time in it's history, winning an interesting match against Ivory Coast. And Columbia continued their amazing form by destroying Japan 4-1.",

That didn't happen. And also the game did not went into a draw, like I was hoping. Both of the teams could blame rain Gods for being cruel to the players who were having really tough time holding, controlling or kicking the ball. There were mis-passes, slip-ups and eventual slow-down. The game started with the German flavour, showcased by both the team (yeah USA as well). However, very quickly it became a game played only in the mid-field. It was boring.

So I switched to the other game being played at the same time, under proper football weather. Sunny and exuberant. Portugal & Ghana both needed a win and that too one having lots of goals. And hence best player of the respective teams tried hard.

Ronaldo especially was running pillar to post and showed real sense of urgency. He was skilful in the mid-field creating chances and passing quickly & exquisitely. His attempts on goal were exotic and tragic at the same time. None of them reached their intended destination. Blocked either by human or wood.

Ghana also, via Gyan, kept their hunt for goals going till the last time. And in the process made mistakes by scoring against themselves.

Eventually Portugal won, Ronaldo scored but none of them were enough. Portugal joined other European expatriates.

<p>That didn't happen. And also the game did not went into a draw, like I was hoping. Both of the teams could blame rain Gods for being cruel to the players who were having really tough time holding, controlling or kicking the ball. There were mis-passes, slip-ups and eventual slow-down. The game started with the German flavour, showcased by both the team (yeah USA as well). However, very quickly it became a game played only in the mid-field. It was boring.</p>

<p>So I switched to the other game being played at the same time, under proper football weather. Sunny and exuberant. Portugal &amp; Ghana both needed a win and that too one having lots of goals. And hence best player of the respective teams tried hard.</p>

<p>Ronaldo especially was running pillar to post and showed real sense of urgency. He was skilful in the mid-field creating chances and passing quickly &amp; exquisitely. His attempts on goal were exotic and tragic at the same time. None of them reached their intended destination. Blocked either by human or wood.</p>

<p>Ghana also, via Gyan, kept their hunt for goals going till the last time. And in the process made mistakes by scoring against themselves.</p>

<p>Eventually Portugal won, Ronaldo scored but none of them were enough. Portugal joined other European expatriates.</p>

<p>And then later Algeria moved to the next stage after a long wait and with commendable aggressive gameplay.</p>

Hulk played his best game of the world cup. And Neymar was not himself, may be coz of the early injury & tension of the big match. But Hulk missed his penalty & Neymar delivered with aplomb.

Brazil suffered from Scolari's undeterred belief in Fred. He was invisible most of the time & useless in the time of need.

Their defence, again, showed it's loopholes in the form of sloppy clearances & opening to quick & pressing counter-attacks. That is going to haunt them more badly if they come face-to-face with Germans in Semis.

Brazilians are still unable to penetrate into a walled defensive strategy. Their tiki-taka style of play need opponent to also attack and make space for Brazilian forwards to spread their legs.

Julio Ceasar made couple of important saves during the normal play and couple of amazing ones in the penalties. He was the hero of the day. Along with Hulk.

Colombia were lethal in their aggression & pace, skilful in their deliveries and composed during the attacks. They were surely the best team against the unexpectedly active Uruguayans.

When Brazil will play against Colombia, sparks will surely fly in the attack but the defence is what would make the difference. I hope both of them would learn from their mistakes. I would give Brazil a bit more awareness as they were almost out whereas Colombians got it a bit more easily.

__Netherlands vs Mexico__

At the outset, Mexico played to win and they should have won. They were the best team with their impenetrable defence, a goalkeeper like a rock & swift counter-attacking mid-field.

Holland, on the other hand, never really felt easy may be because of heat or stunned by the Mexican stubbornness. They hardly made any standard shots on goal. Kuyt had some kind of secret energy inside him to run the whole length of the field although being on the sunny side of the field (while everyone else could hardly maintain their posture like Van Persie) & Robben also tried hard to use his urgent sprints to break through the Mexican defence. All of those attempts were getting blocked and overturned via quick Mexican counter-attacks. One of those attempts resulted in the ball coming to the left leg of Dos Santos, who produced another stunning goal of this World Cup (which is already full of such left-leg stunners).

Moreover, Mexicans had the final wall in the form of Ochero, their goalkeeper. His reflexes need to be studied.

However, one small mistake by the Mexican defence in the first minute of an 6 minute injury time, resulted in a rocket from Sneider that caught Ochero completely unmoved. Holland levelled & things looked dark.

Then came Robben’s diving penalty. Which is going to be seen & discussed again & again for agony & remorse. It was the last nail in the coffin for Mexicans.

They deserved the win, snatched away by a minor slip of attention & tactics of Van Haal during surprising cooling breaks <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>

__Costa Rica vs Greece__

I went to sleep at around 80 minutes in the game thinking that it’s decided. I was so wrong. And that’s the beauty of this game.

Costa Rica played well, not good i.e. below my expectation, and Greece played bad. Goal by Suiz was sweet however their gameplay,  especially in mid-field, raised some glaring questions on their effectiveness going forward.

Greece were never in the game, they were haywire & confused. Costa Rica should have capitalised their incompetence much more lethally but they were also playing a bit more conservatively.

Nevertheless, I liked their game more than the earlier one between Holland & Mexico. These lower ranked teams play like they have nothing to loose and produce a much richer experience in the process.

Post 80 minutes, as I heard and seeing the highlights, Greece found some enlightenment. They attacked hard and their shots were more on target than flying wayward. One of those went inside. And hence resulted the draw which continued past the extra time.

Greece faltered in the penalties that too in the last one via a superb stop by Naas. He became the hero of the match and rightfully deserved that.

__And in quarters__

I don’t see any reason why Holland won’t come strong post their lacklustre performance. And if they did, Costa Rica need to work really hard to strengthen their defence. They need to play more like Mexico <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>

__France vs Nigeria__

I was seeing France play in this World Cup for the first time. All their group stage matches were late night and with weaker teams. And all of them had expected results. So, it will be safe to assume that France was yet to meet a worthy opponent.

Nigeria never seemed to be that opponent. First half, both the teams played conservatively. It’s been the case till now in knockouts, teams save their best for the second half.

France played their quintessential touch & go play in the second half. It was a pleasure seeing them do all those tricks to move the ball around and quickly covering the yards to land inside the Nigerian D-box.

But then there was Enyeama, the Nigerian goalkeeper. He was relentlessly saving attacks till final moments of the game. One misjudgement and another own-goal broke Nigerian dreams.

__Germany vs Algeria__

Truly beautiful game.

Games like these are what my football passionate self crave for.  I liked German win but also got sad for Algerian loss.

I’ve to say from outset, Germany played with all their vigour and there was hardly any major fault in their game. They were strictly disciplined, had mind-blowing ball possession and most of the time accurate in their shots on goal.

But then there was Rais, the Algerian goalkeeper. He surely had a divine connection.

Just for records - Germany had 22 shots on goal and Algeria had 20 saves. Out of 20, most of them were goals by any standard of the game. And then Rais set a standard last night for years to come. He was calm, intelligent & had reflex of a cat to save shots over shots over shots.

His determination were well reciprocated by ruthless Algerian counter-attacks. Making Neuer, lot of times, come down far into the mid-field to curb them. It was such a treat to watch the game of measured German attacks & super-fast Algerian counters.

That went for the whole time of the again. And then Schurrle’s back flip made the troy like wall of Rais fall in the first 3 minutes of extra time. It happened again from Ozil, after few minutes.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Algeria got a nice one in as well but it was really late by then.

This game would be remembered for the determination of one man against, sort of, German blitzkrieg.

__And in quarters__

Germans are better team than France by many factors. But these Europeans giants know very well how to play a World Cup quarterfinal. If Germans continue their current form of undeterred quest for goals, French defence would have to work really hard to stop them. <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>

__Argentina vs Switzerland__

Both of those teams should not be part of the quarters. Their approach towards game was absolutely appalling from the outset.

While Argentina never got the hang of the ball or the field, Swiss players were confused whenever they got the ball and in the process could never contain it for any substantial amount of time.

Messi was not playing his self like he did in the match against Nigeria. He was getting less and less balls from his helpless teammates. And during those few moments of him with ball, almost 3 Swiss defence was right on top of him. Moreover, as and when he tried to create any chance by passing it to a player, they went for personal glory leaving Messi gasping.

He did got Maria open in the dying minutes of the extra time. That brought the end to an already drooling game.

__Belgium vs USA__

This game on the other hand was fast, skilful & overwhelmingly interesting.

Belgium played like it's the finals and USA proved they are not the team who could not yet name the sport right. Both of the teams were hungry for goals and they showed real emergency to achieve them.

And then there was Tim Howard. He created world record by saving more shots on goal than any other goalkeeper. His performance was the real inspiration for both his teammates & the viewers like us.

This game also went into extra time. Belgium scored twice and USA scared them with one (what a goal that was from Green)

__And in quarters__

I'm going to cheer for Belgium when they will play against Argentina. After Germany, they are the best team that's gonna play in quarters. And I am starting to believe that a final between them would be more enticing than any South American component in it.  ",

<p>While Argentina never got the hang of the ball or the field, Swiss players were confused whenever they got the ball and in the process could never contain it for any substantial amount of time.</p>

<p>Messi was not playing his self like he did in the match against Nigeria. He was getting less and less balls from his helpless teammates. And during those few moments of him with ball, almost 3 Swiss defence was right on top of him. Moreover, as and when he tried to create any chance by passing it to a player, they went for personal glory leaving Messi gasping.</p>

<p>He did got Maria open in the dying minutes of the extra time. That brought the end to an already drooling game.</p>

<p><strong>Belgium vs USA</strong></p>

<p>This game on the other hand was fast, skilful &amp; overwhelmingly interesting.</p>

<p>Belgium played like it's the finals and USA proved they are not the team who could not yet name the sport right. Both of the teams were hungry for goals and they showed real emergency to achieve them. </p>

<p>And then there was Tim Howard. He created world record by saving more shots on goal than any other goalkeeper. His performance was the real inspiration for both his teammates &amp; the viewers like us.</p>

<p>This game also went into extra time. Belgium scored twice and USA scared them with one (what a goal that was from Green)</p>

<p><strong>And in quarters</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to cheer for Belgium when they will play against Argentina. After Germany, they are the best team that's gonna play in quarters. And I am starting to believe that a final between them would be more enticing than any South American component in it.  </p>",

Germans pushed and pushed deep into French defense. French mid-field was immensely robust. So there was this precarious deadlock most of the time. And some few chances that both of teams got was restricted by respective goalkeepers. So it was quality match without any fun.

And then there was one small window, Hummels did not miss that chance to put the ball behind net.

France tried hard in the second half. Missed few and blocked others by Neuer.

In the end German plan to have Lahm play more freely from back providing space for Khedira make play with Schweinsteiger resulted in confused French mid-field & defense. It was a battle of strategies that Germans won.

__Brazil vs Colombia__

Abrasive game by both of the teams. Especially by Brazil, surprisingly.

But fouls aside, Colombia never played like many were expecting from them. Their passes & ball possession were mediocre. James tried to show some skills in the mid-field by making chances for others and later taking the onus himself. However strangely Brazilian defense was in their place for the first time. Ironically both of the goals came from defensive players.

Luiz scored a stunner freekick, best so far. But the other goalscorer Silva made a grave mistake fouling and missing the next match.

But the shocker came when Neymar was fouled from back, lifted away in urgency and later being confirmed that he will no more play the world cup.

So Brazil will play Germany without their best attacking & best defensive player.

Its painful to watch the beautiful game being played so rough.  ",

Messi & co saved their best game till now. They showcased all the right tricks that I have always expected from them and which anyone other than Messi have not shown till now in this tournament.

Their passing was deft and fast, their ball control was exemplary and defensively they did show lots of maturity than previous games. Never in the entire game they seemed to be letting loose that focus on the cup which we could not see in their previous encounters with weaker opponents.

The goal from Higuain was also an embodiment of the Argentinian trait of instincts & Messi's unrelenting strive in awesomeness in ball control.

Messi is a true source of inspiration & his tackles with multiple Belgium players at a time was kind of a glowing motivation for the rest of the team. His swift 180 degree turns & accurate teammate marking pass from pressing situations were a treat to watch.

Belgium on the other hand seemed in awe of the Argentinian flamboyance. Their game was average and they seemed really uncomfortable penetrating that reinvigorated Argentinian defense.

Few chances in the dying minutes gave some shimmer of hope to the Belgians, but not enough to stop Argentina moving to World Cup semifinals after 24 years.

This might be their time of glory.

__Netherlands vs Costa Rica__

While the previous game was on individual skills & tactics, this game involved calculated strategies from outside. By outside I mean one person in particular - Holland's manager Van Gaal.

Throughout the tournament his composure & executive stature produced a kind of enigma around him that's  opposite to other physically & emotionally active managers on the ground. He is always noting down points sitting under the roof and never be seen shouting or inspiring his players from the sidelines. He uses the half-time (& cooling time in few matches) to lay down his notes & further plans. His silent demeanor is not be taken for granted. Coz his interesting & highly unexpected strategies has produced favorable results till now & need further study.

Holland were lethal in their ball possession & continuous surge of attacks  all through the game. It's the Costa Rican Lady Luck,  some amount of stern defensive opposition & few daredevil saves by Navas denied Holland at least 3 goals. Overall Costa Rica concentrated more on their defense and could never put pressure back on Neds with their attack.

Once the game went to penalties, it was a rendition of another trait of the sport - mind games. Krul, the replacement goalkeeper of Holland dived to the correct side of Costa Rican player's shot five out of five times. And that is coz he made them disclose their intentions by insinuating himself into their mind. His ways - short talks with Costa Rican players approaching to take the shot & reprimanding figuratively their failure to deceive his diving attempt after the shot. In the process he saved couple of those shots and ensured Costa Rican exodus out of this World Cup.

Such a display of gamesmanship was hardly ever seen before - evocative & effective.

Football is not only a physical sport, it's an immensely tough mind game as well.",

Father called me half an hour into the game (it’s 2 o’clock in the night here) to check whether there is any need to watch the game any more. He had a heavy voice. I could sense the sadness. Brazil was trailing by 5 goals by then.

He was not the only sad person. More than 60 thousands in the stadium and millions all over the world, saw the brutal demolition of their dreams <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>

I don’t know how Brazil could ever come back from this defeat. This one will haunt them for a long time unless they win by a similar margin in their next match for 3rd place. But it won’t be easy.

Match started with a positive energy but that lasted for first 5-6 minutes only. And then one goof-up after another by pathetic Brazilian defence made Germany score almost as casually as a father playing with his kid. They scored 5 goals in the span of 6 minutes.

Scolari should take the 80% of the blame for his laughable & disappointing team selections all through the tournament. Fred played almost in every match till now and he could hardly move himself. David Luiz showed Neymar’s jersey during the anthems and then let him down with his usual callous activities in the defence. Other new faces ,Dante & Rosa, whom Scolari brought in the defence  to cover for the loss of Silva were total let-downers by not tracking men & lazy holding of the ball (that resulted in one of the goal). Maicon and Marcelo were all over the place. And Hulk never could find the ball or space to create any chances. May be he was missing Neymar more than anyone else.

Germans also showed lack of balance and discipline for the first time in the tournament but they were clinical whenever they entered into the Brazilian d-box. Also their defence was highly impenetrable when Brazilians woke up for sometime in the second half. They still use the whole breadth of the field when they counter-attack which made Brazil go helter-skelter in the back. Germans deserved the win and also the that gala of goals.

Last night would be considered a black letter day for Brazil and they need to do a lot if they have to recover from that disaster.

Germans on the other hand played like true champions and rightfully deserve the cup.

Argentine defense and midfield showed real character stopping Holland's ferocious forwards such as Robben and Van Persie and putting few mild pressures back on them. That is a huge development for Argentina from the way they started this tournament.

In the process they have lost bit of that quintessential South American flair & surprise but that's fine. Their conservative gameplay involving long ball possession and dropping way back to deny any kind of space for Holland's attackers survived them from any kind of Brazilian landslide.

Messi got few balls when he was not sorrounded by more than 3 people & also created chances but he was more of an inspiration than champion last night. However Higuan, Zamolleta & Mascherano were the real heroes. They kept pressure from the right wing, covered for each other & showed real skills in tactful passing.

But in the end it came down to goalkeepers, like so many times in this World Cup. Van Gaal surprisingly made his last substitution in the form of a winger in the extra time and not Krul.

And it costed them the match. Ramos on the other hand made one of the most scintillating saves in penalties in recent times.

Argentina did not look like a threat to Germany by their calm & composed play. But we can't just write them out. I am happy that it's not going to be again another all European affair. There is still hope for South Americans to keep the cup with them, although against an opponent who are like a hungry lion in front of the same prey that has been snatched away from him multiple times in the past.

It was painful watching the carnage at Bela Horizonte against Germany, but it's irritating watching the indiscipline against Holland last night.

As the game ended and the crowd booed the home team while they disappear, it seemed whole era & hope of \"the beautiful game\" ended. Current Brazilian players except maybe Neymar (that too in spurts) have no sense or intent to play such a game. And the chances of any resurgence in the future of the same is bleak.

I would rate their performance against Holland much worse than Germany. They got all their time to prepare after last week's catastrophe and they must be knowing that some way, if that pain could be made a little bit bearable was a win. However, they came to the field just to get done with the game. There was no plan or urge to win. Neither did they enrich the senses with their gameplay.

Holland on the other hand actually corrected many mistakes they did during the game against Argentina. The rest of the task done my usual mediocrity of Brazilian defense.

Brazilian football needs a serious Renaissance of sort to withstand the rise of quality in teams around the world. Or else they and their game would just become a sad memory, may be good for some study & reminiscing.",

Current Brazilian players except maybe Neymar (that too in spurts) have no sense or intent to play such a game. And the chances of any resurgence in the future of the same is bleak.</p>

<p>I would rate their performance against Holland much worse than Germany. They got all their time to prepare after last week's catastrophe and they must be knowing that some way, if that pain could be made a little bit bearable was a win. However, they came to the field just to get done with the game. There was no plan or urge to win. Neither did they enrich the senses with their gameplay.</p>

<p>Holland on the other hand actually corrected many mistakes they did during the game against Argentina. The rest of the task done my usual mediocrity of Brazilian defense. </p>

<p>Brazilian football needs a serious Renaissance of sort to withstand the rise of quality in teams around the world. Or else they and their game would just become a sad memory, may be good for some study &amp; reminiscing.</p>",

Let's get one thing out of the way right up - Gujrat might be truly American when it comes to roads and landscaping, it's still Indian at heart when it comes to people driving on those roads.

It was a chilly morning in here at Gandhinagar with wide, green and magnanimous PDP University. Although inside, things were not that merrier. The organisers have no clue what to do with the participants.

Actual proceedings started one and half hours late and that too with lots of bumps during the course of keynote and track briefings.

Once the tracks are briefed, participants followed their relevant track mentors to get lost in a room somewhere in one of the huge buildings all across the campus.

I chose to follow the herd to the room alloted for _Creating Playful Engaging Experiences_ track.

Mentors, Bianca and Thariq, are first year grad student at MIT Media Lab. They are pretty enthusiastic about the whole track. It is an interesting mix of people who have came for the track. Mostly designers from design institutes, design-oriented undergrads & game-enthusiasts.

Rest of the day went in spurs of _ice breaking_, [_design thinking 101_](https://www.dropbox.com/s/936s5j75nd6q7pr/design-thinking.pptx?dl=0), _an interesting ideation game_ and lots of discussions ranging from MIT's being-great bias to how [the block chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#The_block_chain) can be used for prior-art detection & next-gen peer-to-peer communications.

_Fun fact - MIT actually gives out $100 worth of bitcoins to it's students and analyse their spending patterns_

In the next 5 days (last day being the showcase day), the plan is to create game(s) & playful experiences in physical domain leveraging technology (again involving physical devices like [Tessel](https://tessel.io/) & motion detectors) & innovative design thinking. It will take some time to get going as there are many non-programmers to have a flowing prototype phase. Also another plan of mine which is to check out proceedings at other tracks does not seem to be happening just because of the nature of the program (which would require active participation in the chosen track) and disparate locations of the other tracks.

Like it started, the day ended with another logistical collapse. The accommodation I was promised at the start of the day did not happen. Making me to move to a nice hotel in Ahmedabad.

Now, I'm looking forward to the rest of this ordeal.

Today was all about games, how to design a game and lots of, mostly extravagant, ideas.

I want to discuss a bit about people studying design in esteemed institutions like NID. They are good. They do this kind of workshop nearly full time as part of their usual course work. And their ideas most of the time are outrageous. My line of thinking, been in the _industry_ for so long, is mostly pessimistic. I am always leaning towards judging the practical feasibility of any idea from a bias in financial & resource optimisation. Which, to me, limit the scope of my overall endeavour. I feel this exercise might help me broaden my outlook, however demands in enterprise might not allow me to pursue them. And hence we need more folks like those designers who can actually persuade people to go for the ridiculous.

There are guys who are simply awesome - like one who is a chemical engineering student in IIT, Delhi. He is also a part time fashion designer (whose clothes are worn by Lady Gaga!) & now waiting for his machine learning paper on SVM which is due for publishing in a French journal of chemical engineering. And then another lady from Bangalore who is running a small startup that conduct life-skill workshops for youth in enterprise to find their own superheroes (that's her company's name as well!). Talking to such people is very refreshing.

Ok, I deviated from the actual topic. We played a nice game called Mafia. And then discussed, over-analysed and formulated lots of ideas to enhance it. The whole exercise just increased my respect for original designers of such physical games who were the true architect of a system which is immensely extensible in every possible way without losing the original intent i.e. fun.

Game design concepts are very much in alignment to any product design. And more I am hearing Bianca & Thahir unfold aspects of the same design process, I am feeling we can actually have the similar framework work when we are stuck in the process of formalising a product / solution involving some technology.

Later in the afternoon, it was overflow of ideas by people divided in groups. This is the first step to actually figure out what we are gonna do in the next 4 days. The exercise was similar to what we kind of did in the Innomantra workshop I attended last year in Chennai (that's where the comparision ends as rest of it was highly pathetic there).

Most of the ideas were very far-fetched. However, they were very meticulously categorised by Bianca. And I feel that's a superb documentation as it actually enabled us to see how we are starting this ideation process. Also by the time we will be nailing some concrete ones, we would have a better overview of our journey seeing the same. That's important.

I heard other tracks had a similar slow pace to start like ours. However, some of them have ideas to work with some cool stuffs like _Sensors at scale_ might work with Google Glass & Beacons and _Immersive Storytelling_ might use Oculus for their stories. I am sure we can also use those devices provided we come up with ideas where they can be put to use. We'll have to wait and see.

Day started with an exercise leveraging [Idea Hexagon](http://www.slideshare.net/cameraculture/raskar-ideahexagonapr2010) and then followed with more ideas & brainstormings. And then sticky-ranking of ideas across different categories.

![Sticky Ideas](/content/images/2015/02/IMG_0375-copy.jpeg)

Post which we were grouped based on our preferences among these idea categories :

- Social
- Learning
- Health
- Digital Games with Physical Aspects
- Physical Games with Digital Aspects
- Art / Experiences

My preferences were _learning_ & _health_. And after further skill based shuffling of people, I ended up in a group of 4 for _learning_.

The idea was to have people both from tech. & design background in each group.

Then we played a completely silly game called _footloose_. Which was kind of mental-block breaker.

There were around 2-3 hrs of very tiring discussions, brainstorming, & presentations.  We are still not sure what we are gonna do.

The people in _Health_ category have kind of nailed an idea on creating something to inspire people to bike more which will be along the lines of the game _temple run_. More on it in coming days.

In between, we were visited by folks from _synthetic biology_ track to present their idea of a game - that will make people tap their legs on a tune and in process create an unique DNA sequence which will be rendered in real time !!

Also there was a demo by folks from [_Play Lab_](http://playlab.in/) who showcased their Arduino based electronic boards, different kind of connectors & an unique programming environment. It actually is pretty cool. And it would fun to see if some of the groups uses them.

Later in the evening we visited _lifelong learning_ track to learn about a Media Labs product called [Build in Progress](http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/) that helps in documenting design process. It's neat.

The whole design framework that we are undergoing is pretty rigorous and encourages people to burn themselves out over and over again so that they might in the end realise what they really want to do. I am getting it's efficacy when at the start of the day I generally come with an empty mind and during the course of the day I see my pages filling up with an unhealthy amount of ideas. Most of them ridiculous, but still.

Some of our (mostly silly) ideas in learning were:

- A game for kids / teens which has a superhero whose challenge is to beat his nemesis by conversing with him in his language. To do that he has to pass multiple challenges and each challenge will actually teach him different aspects of this new language.

- Parents mimicking their kids or characters in kids books as a task supervised by their kids in return teaching them lessons on taking ownership.

- Game to teach projections with a physical device whose shadow is shown in a 3D digital space

- A MMO game to teach kids the financial aspects of real world like supply-demand & inflation where they have to build their own companies.

After all these intense workouts the whole day, we started our field trip at around 8.30 pm in the night in an old part of Ahmedabad called _Manek Chauk_. It's an interesting place which in the morning is a jewelery market that gets role-reversed into an insane kind of street-food place at night. It's full of authentic Gujrati snacks and desserts which are overwhelmingly tasty and fatty at the same time. We had a great time conversing with vendors, questioning them on various aspects related to our ideas and eating their amazing food.

I'm worn out both by the intensity of activities throughout the day and later by all the butter & cheese I ate there.

Writing this from airport, waiting for flight home, sometimes you just don't want it to end though.

One of those times when people were passing on the departing salutations to each other, I was still thinking we would be grudging on the prototype with new ideas, new ways to try and new failures to take care of till early morning tomorrow to go for a quick nap, shower and back.

Since my last write-up, the days have passed as a complete whirlwind. The moment we started discussing about the actual prototype implementation of our idea.

Our idea - A shadow game for the kids to help them learn concept of physics in a fun way. A conglomeration of physical interactions and digital glamour. The initial idea was to work with projections and optics. Vishes's (majoring in Design at IIT, Guwahati) interest. Quickly out of other ideas, some silly some serious, we all found this to be pretty interesting. I personally was a bit scared of its implementation, as I had no idea about graphics / physics programming. Only plus point was to try out [Tessel](https://tessel.io/) and always love to code in JavaScript.

And then the way it all unfolded over the course of 3 days, including today's demonstrations was highly exhilarating. Those days when we were young and sky seemed to be the limit, for the modern day youth, post attempts like Interstellar &  Kickstarter, limits have raised beyond sky. Working closely with design grads and next-gen engineers for the first time, I realised how pessimistic my outlook has become. When all our actions &  decisions require us to constrain ourselves to the perimeters of business viability,tangible returns &  far future maintainability, we close our eyes &  minds to the state of ridiculous optimistism and chose to carry on in the muddle of pragmatism.

The mere joy of carrying  on with mind blowing prototypes that merely works &  scope changes every next hour for non-stop 50 odd hours is highly enthralling.

Also in the process, I learned tricks of WebGL, learned how to make socket.io work for graphics programming, learned working with Tessel's accelerator & GPIO modules,  graphics programming and felt child-like tingling when making something on my hand control something on the screen.

It was a much required break from monotonousity; to monstrosity. Much better than being lazy in some faraway land, it's a nice rigour for the gray cells.

Met with scintillating talents, some might be those future [_crazy ones_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA).

- what was really great that it's not only us but few of the startup investors visiting the stalls also were interested in our idea and want to take it to the next level. Major morale booster for others in our team
- I just cannot end it without mentioning some of the amazing stuff I saw from other tracks
    + a working 3D Printer for fabrics
    + innovative solutions with conductive fabrics like alarm clock pillow, footfall measuring carpet
    + solution to make blind people feel facial structures in photos
    + low tech innovative solutions for letting villagers know about elephant's positions (without putting anything on the animal itself)
    + extending the famous mobile game Temple Run by providing similar experience for people to cycle more in real life and in the process helping them maintain their health
- And of course, our project's source code is [open source](https://github.com/kaychaks/mit_proj)

_Update_

- Now there is an [Build in Progress page for our project](http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/projects/2313/steps) as well which has better documentation of the whole deign & prototype process",
            "html": "<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Writing this from airport, waiting for flight home, sometimes you just don't want it to end though.</p>

<p>One of those times when people were passing on the departing salutations to each other, I was still thinking we would be grudging on the prototype with new ideas, new ways to try and new failures to take care of till early morning tomorrow to go for a quick nap, shower and back.</p>

<p>Since my last write-up, the days have passed as a complete whirlwind. The moment we started discussing about the actual prototype implementation of our idea.</p>

<p>Our idea - A shadow game for the kids to help them learn concept of physics in a fun way. A conglomeration of physical interactions and digital glamour. The initial idea was to work with projections and optics. Vishes's (majoring in Design at IIT, Guwahati) interest. Quickly out of other ideas, some silly some serious, we all found this to be pretty interesting. I personally was a bit scared of its implementation, as I had no idea about graphics / physics programming. Only plus point was to try out <a href=\"https://tessel.io/\">Tessel</a> and always love to code in JavaScript.</p>

<p>And then the way it all unfolded over the course of 3 days, including today's demonstrations was highly exhilarating. Those days when we were young and sky seemed to be the limit, for the modern day youth, post attempts like Interstellar &amp;  Kickstarter, limits have raised beyond sky. Working closely with design grads and next-gen engineers for the first time, I realised how pessimistic my outlook has become. When all our actions &amp;  decisions require us to constrain ourselves to the perimeters of business viability,tangible returns &amp;  far future maintainability, we close our eyes &amp;  minds to the state of ridiculous optimistism and chose to carry on in the muddle of pragmatism. </p>

<p>The mere joy of carrying  on with mind blowing prototypes that merely works &amp;  scope changes every next hour for non-stop 50 odd hours is highly enthralling. </p>

<p>Also in the process, I learned tricks of WebGL, learned how to make socket.io work for graphics programming, learned working with Tessel's accelerator &amp; GPIO modules,  graphics programming and felt child-like tingling when making something on my hand control something on the screen.</p>

<p>It was a much required break from monotonousity; to monstrosity. Much better than being lazy in some faraway land, it's a nice rigour for the gray cells.</p>

<p>Met with scintillating talents, some might be those future <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA\"><em>crazy ones</em></a>.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>what was really great that it's not only us but few of the startup investors visiting the stalls also were interested in our idea and want to take it to the next level. Major morale booster for others in our team</li>
<li>I just cannot end it without mentioning some of the amazing stuff I saw from other tracks
<ul><li>a working 3D Printer for fabrics</li>
<li>innovative solutions with conductive fabrics like alarm clock pillow, footfall measuring carpet</li>
<li>solution to make blind people feel facial structures in photos</li>
<li>low tech innovative solutions for letting villagers know about elephant's positions (without putting anything on the animal itself)</li>
<li>extending the famous mobile game Temple Run by providing similar experience for people to cycle more in real life and in the process helping them maintain their health</li></ul></li>
<li>And of course, our project's source code is <a href=\"https://github.com/kaychaks/mit_proj\">open source</a></li>

I think Twitter & all the new faces around there is going to do something drastic and that's gonna completely destroy the current experience.

---

By the way, I'm planning to be more regular in my blogging, as long as it last. With that in mind, I've made some nice changes to my Ghost setup so that I could have link blogs & also cross-post to Medium.

I am planning to do the same things as I used to do in Twitter i.e. mostly around 150 - 200 word posts with a link & occasional long-form outbursts. So that once Twitter becomes unusable I would still have some place to hang around.

<p>I think Twitter &amp; all the new faces around there is going to do something drastic and that's gonna completely destroy the current experience.</p>

<p>By the way, I'm planning to be more regular in my blogging, as long as it last. With that in mind, I've made some nice changes to my Ghost setup so that I could have link blogs &amp; also cross-post to Medium.</p>

<p>I am planning to do the same things as I used to do in Twitter i.e. mostly around 150 - 200 word posts with a link &amp; occasional long-form outbursts. So that once Twitter becomes unusable I would still have some place to hang around.</p>",

Its seems to be a nice proposal that has tenets I don't understand fully right now. My aim is to strive for those times when I could comprehend those aspects. I will write about my adventures.

            "markdown": "The Accelerated Mobile Project from Google has its heart at the right place being open source but it also can be an interesting attempt to get public onboard to showing ads before showing ads !

Its a shame that in 2015 Google has to come up with all these innovations to render bunch of static pages fast and without drama in our browser, especially the mobile ones. The direction here is produce a constrained environment for nothing other than a bunch of text (and some safe media) along with ads (that won't suck).

However, in all these if anything that's gonna get its long due visibility is the [*web components*](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) spec. And that's why I'm interested.

Some features of [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/how-it-works/)

* AMP HTML documents would not include any author-written JavaScript, nor any third-party scripts.
* AMP Components are implemented using couple of great solutions of the web platform: [custom elements](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/) and [web components](http://webcomponents.org/). AMP components may have JavaScript under the hood, but it is coordinated with other AMP components, so its composition into the page doesn’t cause performance degradation.
* “tracking pixels” can be embedded into AMP documents as long as they don’t use JavaScript.
* More advanced analytics are currently not supported. Vision is to deploy a single, unified, auditable, high performance, open source analytics library with AMP HTML that can report to various existing analytics provider backends, so it is possible to use the existing ecosystem without overloading a page with analytics software.
* AMP HTML doesn’t allow JavaScript so ads cannot be directly embedded – instead they live in *sandboxed iframes* with no access to the primary document
* AMP HTML has been added the ability to tell a document: render yourself, but only as far as what is visible above the fold and only elements which are not CPU intensive to minimize the cost of pre-rendering
* Google is offering a service that delivers AMP HTML documents given their URL through its CDN. *Others can use this service* or make their own or serve AMP HTML pages from a plain-old-web-server.
* All resource loading is controlled by the AMP library and, more importantly, resources must declare their sizing up-front. Document authors have to state resource sizes explicitly. This doesn’t mean that resources can’t be responsive – they can be, but their aspect ratio or dimensions needs to be inferable from the HTML alone.

All said and done when it comes to low latency web app & *instant loading* of web pages there is still much more required over at the server & also over the wire. And there comes the Google's [Serving Service](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-format.md#amp-html-).

>AMP HTML are also designed to be optionally served through specialized AMP serving systems that proxy AMP documents. These documents serve them from their own origin and are allowed to apply transformations to the document that provide additional performance benefits. An incomplete list of optimizations such a serving system might do is:

>* Replace image references with images sized to the viewer’s viewport.
* Inline images that are visible above the fold.
* Inline CSS variables.
* Preload extended components.
* Minify HTML and CSS

---

Coming back to the web components (the central piece of all these implementations & bold claims) -

>AMP HTML uses a set of contributed but centrally managed and hosted custom elements to implement advanced functionality such as image galleries that might be found in an AMP HTML document.

Here're somethings I am still not clear though

* if the core part of the design is around custom elements then why the `amp-ad` is based on iFrames. *I think it's because of the still unresolved complications with shadow DOM implementations across browsers.*

* Also, till the recent working group discussions browser vendor especially Google & Apple were still pondering on the [right implementations of custom elements spec](http://www.2ality.com/2015/08/web-component-status.html). Have they sorted out the details ? If not, is AMP going to use polyfills while rendering in Safari. I could not locate Polymer in the build script of AMP. Although, I found this comment though in their [`base-element.js`](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/base-element.js)

![custom custom-component](/content/images/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-12-at-7-36-01-am.png)

This clearly shows that since its just custom elements that AMP is concerned about, they have written the same from scratch rather than using their own Polymer polyfills.

Apart from the built-in components Google is providing ways to create extended / third-party components. However, these components to become widely used or recognised need to be contributed & will have to pass [an approval process by Google & other partners :](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-components.md#extended-components)

>* To be considered for inclusion into the official AMP components, a contributed component must:

There are some other interesting decisions Google has taken here like keeping things pretty restricted for now just to prevent any kind of misuse & also to control the behaviour of the system from a performance perspective. The levels are as insane as Apple's control on iOS ecosystem

* Most of the important HTML tags are prohibited e.g. script, form, input elements & iframe.
* Initial version of AMP will only allow very simple CSS selectors in AMPs. The restriction is in place to make overall performance easier to reason about
* The AMP runtime is a piece of JavaScript that runs inside every AMP document. It provides implementations for AMP custom elements, manages resource loading and prioritization and optionally includes a runtime validator for AMP HTML for use during development.
* There are no particular guarantees as to the loading behavior of the AMP runtime, but it should generally strive to load resources quickly enough, so that they are loaded by the time the user would like to see them if possible. The runtime should prioritize resources currently in viewport and attempt to predict changes to the viewport and preload resources accordingly.

---

Lastly, being Google there is some Linked Data goodness [also involved here](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-format.md#html-tags)

* Script tag is prohibited unless the type is application/ld+json (Other non-executable values may be added as needed.). Exception is the mandatory script tag to load the AMP runtime and the script tags to load extended components.

An example format with Schema.Org tags will look something like this

All of this might be an attempt in response to Facebook's Instant Article or Apple's iOS9 News app but being open source and some heavyweight content creators on board this might be that hallmark app for web components spec (and may be also for static content on the web). But as Google is saying it's just the initial draft and things might completely change in the coming days, I'm sure there will be much more to write about it in future.
",
            "html": "<p>The Accelerated Mobile Project from Google has its heart at the right place being open source but it also can be an interesting attempt to get public onboard to showing ads before showing ads !</p>

<p>Its a shame that in 2015 Google has to come up with all these innovations to render bunch of static pages fast and without drama in our browser, especially the mobile ones. The direction here is produce a constrained environment for nothing other than a bunch of text (and some safe media) along with ads (that won't suck).</p>

<p>However, in all these if anything that's gonna get its long due visibility is the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/\"><em>web components</em></a> spec. And that's why I'm interested.</p>

<p>Some features of <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/how-it-works/\">AMP</a></p>

<ul>
<li>AMP HTML documents would not include any author-written JavaScript, nor any third-party scripts.</li>
<li>AMP Components are implemented using couple of great solutions of the web platform: <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/\">custom elements</a> and <a href=\"http://webcomponents.org/\">web components</a>. AMP components may have JavaScript under the hood, but it is coordinated with other AMP components, so its composition into the page doesn’t cause performance degradation.</li>
<li>“tracking pixels” can be embedded into AMP documents as long as they don’t use JavaScript.</li>
<li>More advanced analytics are currently not supported. Vision is to deploy a single, unified, auditable, high performance, open source analytics library with AMP HTML that can report to various existing analytics provider backends, so it is possible to use the existing ecosystem without overloading a page with analytics software.</li>
<li>AMP HTML doesn’t allow JavaScript so ads cannot be directly embedded – instead they live in <em>sandboxed iframes</em> with no access to the primary document</li>
<li>AMP HTML has been added the ability to tell a document: render yourself, but only as far as what is visible above the fold and only elements which are not CPU intensive to minimize the cost of pre-rendering</li>
<li>Google is offering a service that delivers AMP HTML documents given their URL through its CDN. <em>Others can use this service</em> or make their own or serve AMP HTML pages from a plain-old-web-server.</li>
<li>All resource loading is controlled by the AMP library and, more importantly, resources must declare their sizing up-front. Document authors have to state resource sizes explicitly. This doesn’t mean that resources can’t be responsive – they can be, but their aspect ratio or dimensions needs to be inferable from the HTML alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>All said and done when it comes to low latency web app &amp; <em>instant loading</em> of web pages there is still much more required over at the server &amp; also over the wire. And there comes the Google's <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-format.md#amp-html-\">Serving Service</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AMP HTML are also designed to be optionally served through specialized AMP serving systems that proxy AMP documents. These documents serve them from their own origin and are allowed to apply transformations to the document that provide additional performance benefits. An incomplete list of optimizations such a serving system might do is:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Replace image references with images sized to the viewer’s viewport.</li>
  <li>Inline images that are visible above the fold.</li>
  <li>Inline CSS variables.</li>
  <li>Preload extended components.</li>
  <li>Minify HTML and CSS</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Coming back to the web components (the central piece of all these implementations &amp; bold claims) - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AMP HTML uses a set of contributed but centrally managed and hosted custom elements to implement advanced functionality such as image galleries that might be found in an AMP HTML document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here're somethings I am still not clear though</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the core part of the design is around custom elements then why the <code>amp-ad</code> is based on iFrames. <em>I think it's because of the still unresolved complications with shadow DOM implementations across browsers.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Also, till the recent working group discussions browser vendor especially Google &amp; Apple were still pondering on the <a href=\"http://www.2ality.com/2015/08/web-component-status.html\">right implementations of custom elements spec</a>. Have they sorted out the details ? If not, is AMP going to use polyfills while rendering in Safari. I could not locate Polymer in the build script of AMP. Although, I found this comment though in their <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/src/base-element.js\"><code>base-element.js</code></a> </p></li>
</ul>

[GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/) is new way of fetching data from server championed at Facebook. It's a spec, mostly straightforward, which needs to be followed both at server and client to achieve its goals of a schema backed data correspondence.

[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) is an extension of GraphQL which is an attempt to bring sanity in other practical aspects of data management at the client especially for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) based applications. However, being a spec it's not a React only thing.

I am attempting to port a fully semantic model based web application with mildly complex user interface and rich with REST & adhoc endpoints to GraphQL-Relay-React land.

As I mentioned before, GraphQL as a spec and Facebook's [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) is pretty straightforward. Moreover, as my backend is nothing but bunch of RDFs stored in a triple store backed by an OWL based semantic model, creating a GraphQL schema for the client was not that challenging.

The real challenge comes when Relay comes into picture.

Relay tries to simplify some practical pain points of front-end development like data flow between UI components, state  / scope management , both local and global, separation of concern while fetching data from server, managing timeouts and retries. And for that it takes the convention over configuration approach. By design, it's built with React in mind (but there is no reason why it can't be used without it).

GraphQL has the term *query* as part of its name and for a good reason. As long as the application is asking for data from server, everything works fine. But to have any meaningful implementation, we need write some data. Or as they say in functional world, we need to have side effects. In GraphQL land, its called *Mutations*.

Mutations are a late addition to the spec and again simple enough. It just mandates client to say along with what they want to write to also mention how is that gonna change the overall system. I.e. there is `payload object` for every mutation request which clients should leverage to ask GraphQL server to fetch everything that that they think might have changed because of what they have done. At a client level it's somewhat similar to a Monadic system (without the required laws though) where the overall state is also part of the input & output.

Relay's take on mutations is still a bit rusty. Both at the spec level as well as in the current implementation. Having said that, I am pretty confident on the job the committers at Facebook and others in the open are doing.

The documentation around mutations in Relay is pretty weak. Other than [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmke4w4gc6c) and some posts explaining simple scenarios, the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-mutations.html#content) and source code of [these examples](https://github.com/facebook/relay/tree/master/examples) as part of relay framework is the best we've got right now.

There are some important discussions around mutations is happening as Github issues and StackOverflow questions.

*I just want to reiterate, Relay (more than GraphQL) needs a different way of thinking in building client-server applications. I will surely have more to write on it (in much smaller doses than this one) as I tread deep into this land.*

Here are few of my realisations for now

---

- [Object Identification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-object-identification.html#content) is an important concept when working with Relay-on-React(RoR). In almost all of the examples of Relay, the entry to the application happens by fetching a collection of a particular type which means that Relay store gets to know about the IDs of the individual instances.

 - These IDs as mentioned in the documentation are *opaque* which in other words is the domain agnostic way for both client and server to identify an instance. It's synonymous to ID column in databases (SQL & NOSQL both) which is different from the domain specific identification of the same instance.

 - Relay Store saves those IDs as `__dataID__` for each instance that it tracks and then use the same for all it's data fetching exercise like when some React component would want to get additional information of those instance or the instance changes state as a result of some mutation.

 - Unless the ID of an instance remains consistent to what Relay saves and what server sends, there will be weird warning / error messages from Relay. Or Relay won't bother creating the right query to GraphQL server. Which is more frustrating as I spent a lot of time debugging my application rather than looking at the request created by Relay.

 - A way that worked for me and I think something that is recommended when thinking in Relay is that

     - your instances are always expected be treated with an unique ID that follows a pattern and is different of from the domain specific identifier (if any)

      - the pattern is known to server so that it can be deciphered in the resolve function of your `Node` definition and the domain specific ID is used for further processing

     - Relay client should be unaware of the pattern so that the separation of concern remains intact

     - the same id, however, should be used whenever Relay client need to identify the instance e.g. in `getConfigs` method of `Mutation` class or a React component creating query `fragments` for relevant information of the same instance

     - Relay store internally maps the `id` field of the `Node` type (Relay specific interface for your GraphQL schema) to `__dataID__` and then use the same to track the same instance across the application boundaries. Our app need not concern with the internal representation but be very sure that the `id` of our instance is consistent & available to Relay store at all times. Best way to check the same is via [React Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) where we can see what `props` data Relay containers are having.

- [Mutation apis](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/api-reference-relay-mutation.html#content) at client side is still developing and some major updates are coming in future releases of relay. One confusing feature is the `RANGE_ADD` configuration for the Relay mutator

  - If as a result of a mutation, some new `edges` are added to an existing `connection` (Relay's way to represent the graph of associations between GraphQL types e.g. a `user` type has a connection `todos` to represent list of `todo` types), the mutation should have a `connectionEdge` as one of the output fields

  - the same edge then can be used in the `getFatQuery` and `getConfigs` function of the Mutation to ask Relay store to magically take care of replicating the same addition operation in it's store mimicking what happened at the server side. It's a really powerful feature but still has some rough edges especially when it throws weird warnings and fail silently. So here is what worked for me

     - the `RANGE_ADD` option for the mutator will only work for instances that are already getting tracked by Relay. In other words, if the `connection` in question is not queried before by any component then Relay is going to skip asking for it when it frames the final mutation query and show this weird warning - `newly created edge <edge_name> and its <node_name> field. Did you forget to update the RANGE_ADD mutation config?`.

      - Relay only looks for common fields when it does intersection between what's asked in the `getFatQuery` and what exactly it's components need as per their `getFragments` definition. So, check that the connection is at least used in one of the component's `fragments`.

     - in future updates the above warning message will be replaced with relevant message based on whether the problem is at the client end (i.e. when connection is never queried before being asked as part of the mutation) or at the server side when server is not including the new edge as part of the mutation payload. Check out [issue #542](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/542) for the discussion and [issue #574](https://github.com/facebook/relay/pull/574) for a possible implementation

      - in cases where you still need to get fields
in the mutation payload which are not being asked by any component, there is a new option `REQUIRED_CHILDREN` which would force Relay to include the relevant fields in its mutation query. Check out [issue #237](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/237)",

<p>There are some important discussions around mutations is happening as Github issues and StackOverflow questions.</p>

<p><em>I just want to reiterate, Relay (more than GraphQL) needs a different way of thinking in building client-server applications. I will surely have more to write on it (in much smaller doses than this one) as I tread deep into this land.</em></p>

<p>Here are few of my realisations for now</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li><p><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-object-identification.html#content\">Object Identification</a> is an important concept when working with Relay-on-React(RoR). In almost all of the examples of Relay, the entry to the application happens by fetching a collection of a particular type which means that Relay store gets to know about the IDs of the individual instances.  </p>

<ul><li><p>These IDs as mentioned in the documentation are <em>opaque</em> which in other words is the domain agnostic way for both client and server to identify an instance. It's synonymous to ID column in databases (SQL &amp; NOSQL both) which is different from the domain specific identification of the same instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Relay Store saves those IDs as <code>__dataID__</code> for each instance that it tracks and then use the same for all it's data fetching exercise like when some React component would want to get additional information of those instance or the instance changes state as a result of some mutation.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless the ID of an instance remains consistent to what Relay saves and what server sends, there will be weird warning / error messages from Relay. Or Relay won't bother creating the right query to GraphQL server. Which is more frustrating as I spent a lot of time debugging my application rather than looking at the request created by Relay.</p></li>
<li><p>A way that worked for me and I think something that is recommended when thinking in Relay is that </p>

<ul><li><p>your instances are always expected be treated with an unique ID that follows a pattern and is different of from the domain specific identifier (if any)</p></li>
<li><p>the pattern is known to server so that it can be deciphered in the resolve function of your <code>Node</code> definition and the domain specific ID is used for further processing</p></li>
<li><p>Relay client should be unaware of the pattern so that the separation of concern remains intact</p></li>
<li><p>the same id, however, should be used whenever Relay client need to identify the instance e.g. in <code>getConfigs</code> method of <code>Mutation</code> class or a React component creating query <code>fragments</code> for relevant information of the same instance</p></li>
<li><p>Relay store internally maps the <code>id</code> field of the <code>Node</code> type (Relay specific interface for your GraphQL schema) to <code>__dataID__</code> and then use the same to track the same instance across the application boundaries. Our app need not concern with the internal representation but be very sure that the <code>id</code> of our instance is consistent &amp; available to Relay store at all times. Best way to check the same is via <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi\">React Chrome Plugin</a> where we can see what <code>props</code> data Relay containers are having.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><p><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/api-reference-relay-mutation.html#content\">Mutation apis</a> at client side is still developing and some major updates are coming in future releases of relay. One confusing feature is the <code>RANGE_ADD</code> configuration for the Relay mutator</p>

<ul><li><p>If as a result of a mutation, some new <code>edges</code> are added to an existing <code>connection</code> (Relay's way to represent the graph of associations between GraphQL types e.g. a <code>user</code> type has a connection <code>todos</code> to represent list of <code>todo</code> types), the mutation should have a <code>connectionEdge</code> as one of the output fields</p></li>
<li><p>the same edge then can be used in the <code>getFatQuery</code> and <code>getConfigs</code> function of the Mutation to ask Relay store to magically take care of replicating the same addition operation in it's store mimicking what happened at the server side. It's a really powerful feature but still has some rough edges especially when it throws weird warnings and fail silently. So here is what worked for me</p>

<ul><li><p>the <code>RANGE_ADD</code> option for the mutator will only work for instances that are already getting tracked by Relay. In other words, if the <code>connection</code> in question is not queried before by any component then Relay is going to skip asking for it when it frames the final mutation query and show this weird warning - <code>newly created edge &lt;edge_name&gt; and its &lt;node_name&gt; field. Did you forget to update the RANGE_ADD mutation config?</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Relay only looks for common fields when it does intersection between what's asked in the <code>getFatQuery</code> and what exactly it's components need as per their <code>getFragments</code> definition. So, check that the connection is at least used in one of the component's <code>fragments</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>in future updates the above warning message will be replaced with relevant message based on whether the problem is at the client end (i.e. when connection is never queried before being asked as part of the mutation) or at the server side when server is not including the new edge as part of the mutation payload. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/542\">issue #542</a> for the discussion and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/relay/pull/574\">issue #574</a> for a possible implementation</p></li>
<li><p>in cases where you still need to get fields
in the mutation payload which are not being asked by any component, there is a new option <code>REQUIRED_CHILDREN</code> which would force Relay to include the relevant fields in its mutation query. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/237\">issue #237</a></p></li></ul></li></ul></li>

sudo ln -s

/etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem

sudo ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.kaushikc.org/privkey.pem /etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem

```

* Reload nginx
```
sudo service nginx reload

Erlang is gaining traction nowadays as the language (or platform) of choice especially to build IoT edge gateways, web servers (thanks Phoenix) & general actor-based distributed systems.

The keynote is [available in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqHdULqet0) so every browser could play it, same keynote in [Apple's website](http://apple.co/2svxHNj) could be streamed in every browser **but** none of the [session videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2017/) could be streamed in any browser other than Apple's own Safari and they are not in YouTube. *Any guesses on why such discrepancy !*

In the [What's new in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/402/) session, presenters were talking on some new features geared towards server side Swift. Unfortunately, all those developers who are in Linux using Chrome thinking about using _open source_ Swift for their next system software or server side usage can't see / listen them.

There is always the option to download SD (min. size 400 MB) / HD (min. size 1.4 GB) videos of sessions, _am sure that'll be a really nice experience._

[Apple's support handle](https://twitter.com/AppleSupport) in Twitter is [confused](https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/876141756227751936) about it and developer forum is [mum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/237245#237245).
