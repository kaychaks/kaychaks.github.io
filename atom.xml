    <p><strong>Senegal 0 - Columbia 1</strong></p>
<p>Senegal is going home because of the wrong gameplan, and some bad luck. Their plan to play for a draw rarely works in World Cup. Only mature teams with a strong defence could pull that off. Senegal was deliberately downplaying their attacking abilities. Some discipline in earlier games might have saved their chances. But that’s no reason to play poor football. Columbians have to work hard on all fronts for their showoff with England. The final day of the group games was everyone playing safe and saving their energy for the knockouts. Let’s hope they don’t disappoint there.</p>

    <p><strong>Germany 0 - South Korea 2</strong></p>
<p>I must admit that I was shocked when the final whistle ended the depressing game. Not because of what the results meant but by the way the Germans approached the game. It had all the signs of being a pre-determined outcome. But let’s not dwell on controversies so early. Germany’s lack of dedication and no desire to win was clear from the get-go. They looked tired from the first half and their attempts at goals were callous. None of them showed any urgency during the final minutes as well. Germany had to work hard to fix the team dynamics and up-the-ante on their attack. It’s a bitter crash out and a sad ending.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 2 - Serbia 0</strong></p>
<p>Brazilians have got their groove back, finally. It was a joy watching Neymar active and pushing. And that old serendipitous style of pushing the ball up into the opponent’s half. There was some dullness in the second half though which the Serbs wanted to grasp but could not. Brazilians still need to work on ball possession and pass accuracy, especially in the midfield. Because with this form it will not be easy tackling the confident Mexicans in the knockouts.</p>

    <p><strong>Argentina 2 - Nigeria 1</strong></p>
<p>It’s a shame that Argentina is still in this tournament and Nigeria isn’t. Nigerians were fast and passionate but lacked discipline in their passes. And their strikers could not convert simple one-on-one chances. But the Argentinians played even worse. Especially during later part of the second half. Apart from the beauty of Banega’s pass to Messy for a much-awaited goal from the star, Argentina played like any World Cup debutant team. Their defence was fickle. And their ball control – much like their shots on goal – lost steam as the game progressed. Their next meeting is with a team who, much like them, have not played to their full potential – France. Hope both of them get serious and showcase some genuine football.</p>

    <p><strong>Portugal 1 - Iran 1</strong></p>
<p>It’s already <em>knockouts</em> mindset with the teams. As this is the final week of group games and most of the groups have no clear toppers. Portugal had to draw and Iran had to win to stay alive. And as has been the character of this World Cup the game went to the wire. Iran played their best during the last 3 minutes of the additional time. They should have accelerated much earlier. Portugal will play Uruguay in the next round – who played their best game against Russia earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>England got a grip and showered good football. And also all those goals. Wish they continue the same momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Senegal 2 - Japan 2</strong></p>
<p>This was one of the best matches so far. Both the teams played a fast-paced and technically profound game. Senegal like last time proved they can maintain their stamina and passion for as long as they want. But Japan also levelled them – first by coming back from behind for both of their goals and then by maintaining their attacking spirit till the end of the game. Japan might have it easy for their last match to progress to the next round. But Senegal would have to face a do-or-die with Columbia!</p>

<p>When Tony Kroos got the ball bending inside the net at 94th minute it was a perfect a payback for the blunder he did leading to the Swedish lead in the first half. But more than that it might trigger a German comeback of sorts in this World Cup. Which could also mean a potential Germany vs Brazil match in the next round!</p>

    <p>When teams go back to their foundation and play as they are known for, nice things happen. But it only happens during desperate times.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 2 - Costa Rica 0</strong></p>
<p>For the whole time during the scheduled 90 minutes Brazil played the same boring game that they had suddenly discovered in the first game. And like the first game, there was nothing happening. And then suddenly they remembered their lost style. It was those few instances of unpredictable pass &amp; exquisite leg work which brought back good memories. Well, all those serendipities finally produced the intended outcome. Hope they don’t return to their new found stupidity again.</p>
<p><strong>Nigeria 2 - Iceland 0</strong></p>
<p>It was the similar kind of foundational African power play that made Nigeria overpower Icelandic defence with ease. This win might impact Argentina’s qualification chances. But it was a pretty amazing game of football by the mighty Africans.</p>

    <p>Every World Cup few over-hyped teams underperform. It seems the number of such teams is the most this time.</p>
<p><strong>France 1 - Peru 0</strong></p>
<p>France is through to next round thanks to their second unconvincing win. Many considered them to be the team to watch out for this time. Many proclaimed them to be fast, young &amp; skilful of all the big nations taking part in this World Cup. Alas, they showed none of that in their matches so far. Rather Peru was the dominating party during most of the time in this match. It would be interesting to see how far they can ride on their luck.</p>
<p><strong>Argentina 0 - Croatia 3</strong></p>
<p>Argentina had no such luck favouring them though. It’s appalling to witness the demise of a team with a legend &amp; legendary past. After suffering the first goal, Argentinian coach sent all his young &amp; promising strikers to neutralise the situation. But the Croatian gameplay was astounding. They were aggressive, fast &amp; relentless. They not only made Messi lose his skills with the ball but also his usual calm. It was a pity to see Maradona crumbling in the stands hoping some <em>hand of God</em> might save this Argentinian descent.</p>

<p>Is this the time for real Ronaldo to stand up and shine like Euro 2016? Or it’s a matter of time till their luck runs out?</p>
<p>They had a similar start back in 2016 when they picked up steam very late. But, Ronaldo’s impact is there both on the ball as well as on his teammates. Although they have serious issues to take care with ball possession, mid-field play and callous defence, an immense amount of uplifting energy flows through his mates as soon as Ronaldo make his run for the ball. We will have to wait to see how long will this living on the edge continue.</p>

    <p><strong>Senegal 2 - Poland 1</strong></p>
<p>African teams are always passionate and hard-working which makes them fun to watch. And there will be some lone star in those teams who would play many roles – motivator, leader, and executor. Sadio Mané might not be Didier Drogba but he still infuses a lot of enthusiasm among his teammates. Senegal displayed all that might against Poland. It was refreshing to watch them go on with the same stamina and power in the 90th minute as they had in the beginning. They were skilful in the midfield, had a solid defence &amp; nice strategic gameplay. Some of their issues lie when they enter opponent’s penalty box. Their shot selection, execution and collaboration in there was weak. Also, they need to work on their set-pieces. Mané seemed pale and was playing way back. Maybe coz he was not sure of the kind of support that he gets while playing for Liverpool. Or maybe he was saving his skills for those big matches. I would like to see them in the next round(s).</p>
