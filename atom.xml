    <p><strong>Portugal 1 - Iran 1</strong></p>
<p>It’s already <em>knockouts</em> mindset with the teams. As this is the final week of group games and most of the groups have no clear toppers. Portugal had to draw and Iran had to win to stay alive. And as has been the character of this World Cup the game went to the wire. Iran played their best during the last 3 minutes of the additional time. They should have accelerated much earlier. Portugal will play Uruguay in the next round – who played their best game against Russia earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>England got a grip and showered good football. And also all those goals. Wish they continue the same momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Senegal 2 - Japan 2</strong></p>
<p>This was one of the best matches so far. Both the teams played a fast-paced and technically profound game. Senegal like last time proved they can maintain their stamina and passion for as long as they want. But Japan also levelled them – first by coming back from behind for both of their goals and then by maintaining their attacking spirit till the end of the game. Japan might have it easy for their last match to progress to the next round. But Senegal would have to face a do-or-die with Columbia!</p>

    <p><strong>Germany 2 - Sweden 1</strong></p>
<p>When Tony Kroos got the ball bending inside the net at 94th minute it was a perfect a payback for the blunder he did leading to the Swedish lead in the first half. But more than that it might trigger a German comeback of sorts in this World Cup. Which could also mean a potential Germany vs Brazil match in the next round!</p>

    <p>When teams go back to their foundation and play as they are known for, nice things happen. But it only happens during desperate times.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 2 - Costa Rica 0</strong></p>
<p>For the whole time during the scheduled 90 minutes Brazil played the same boring game that they had suddenly discovered in the first game. And like the first game, there was nothing happening. And then suddenly they remembered their lost style. It was those few instances of unpredictable pass &amp; exquisite leg work which brought back good memories. Well, all those serendipities finally produced the intended outcome. Hope they don’t return to their new found stupidity again.</p>
<p><strong>Nigeria 2 - Iceland 0</strong></p>
<p>It was the similar kind of foundational African power play that made Nigeria overpower Icelandic defence with ease. This win might impact Argentina’s qualification chances. But it was a pretty amazing game of football by the mighty Africans.</p>

    <p>Every World Cup few over-hyped teams underperform. It seems the number of such teams is the most this time.</p>
<p><strong>France 1 - Peru 0</strong></p>
<p>France is through to next round thanks to their second unconvincing win. Many considered them to be the team to watch out for this time. Many proclaimed them to be fast, young &amp; skilful of all the big nations taking part in this World Cup. Alas, they showed none of that in their matches so far. Rather Peru was the dominating party during most of the time in this match. It would be interesting to see how far they can ride on their luck.</p>
<p><strong>Argentina 0 - Croatia 3</strong></p>
<p>Argentina had no such luck favouring them though. It’s appalling to witness the demise of a team with a legend &amp; legendary past. After suffering the first goal, Argentinian coach sent all his young &amp; promising strikers to neutralise the situation. But the Croatian gameplay was astounding. They were aggressive, fast &amp; relentless. They not only made Messi lose his skills with the ball but also his usual calm. It was a pity to see Maradona crumbling in the stands hoping some <em>hand of God</em> might save this Argentinian descent.</p>

<p>Is this the time for real Ronaldo to stand up and shine like Euro 2016? Or it’s a matter of time till their luck runs out?</p>
<p>They had a similar start back in 2016 when they picked up steam very late. But, Ronaldo’s impact is there both on the ball as well as on his teammates. Although they have serious issues to take care with ball possession, mid-field play and callous defence, an immense amount of uplifting energy flows through his mates as soon as Ronaldo make his run for the ball. We will have to wait to see how long will this living on the edge continue.</p>

    <p><strong>Senegal 2 - Poland 1</strong></p>
<p>African teams are always passionate and hard-working which makes them fun to watch. And there will be some lone star in those teams who would play many roles – motivator, leader, and executor. Sadio Mané might not be Didier Drogba but he still infuses a lot of enthusiasm among his teammates. Senegal displayed all that might against Poland. It was refreshing to watch them go on with the same stamina and power in the 90th minute as they had in the beginning. They were skilful in the midfield, had a solid defence &amp; nice strategic gameplay. Some of their issues lie when they enter opponent’s penalty box. Their shot selection, execution and collaboration in there was weak. Also, they need to work on their set-pieces. Mané seemed pale and was playing way back. Maybe coz he was not sure of the kind of support that he gets while playing for Liverpool. Or maybe he was saving his skills for those big matches. I would like to see them in the next round(s).</p>

    <p>A day with less drama. Still, England maintained their tradition of displaying careless game-play in the world cups.</p>
<p><strong>Belgium 3 - Panama 0</strong></p>
<p>It was a game between a team of battle-tested individuals against the World Cup debutantes. And it concluded with an expected outcome. But Panama could constrain Belgians in the first half. In the second half, their legs gave up. Belgian game in the second half had glimpses of fine play which is worthy of a notice. Belgians might have a good shot at the crown, unlike their group mate –England</p>
<p><strong>England 2 - Tunisia 1</strong></p>
<p>English struggle in world cup finals continues. They took 91 minutes to score the winning goal. Against a team which struggled to keep the ball to themselves. Even though the English players pushed deep most of the time, their game was unconvincing. It will take a lot than what the English have showcased for a better progress this time.</p>

    <p>All matches today resulted against any cat, pig or expert’s predictions. It’s a fine day for football when the team that persevered got to keep the fame. And in all three matches, it was the underdog that shined against the stronger but poor opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Germany 0 - Mexico 1</strong></p>
<p>A stunning match giving this World Cup’s first stunner. It had the highest number of shots on the goal by both teams (Germany of course more than Mexico). And highest number of stupid one-on-one misses by the Mexicans. Mexico gets more score coz of their tactical gameplay. They applied the same counterattacking strategy that the Germans used 4 years back. Mexico lacked individual skills in &amp; around the penalty box. And hence failed to convert all those straightforward one-on-ones. Still, they stood their ground against the German blitzkrieg.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil 1 - Switzerland 1</strong></p>
<p>One could not have missed the Swiss brilliance in this high stakes game. Whether it’s fouling Neymar or testing Brazilian defence. While in the previous game teams played in someone’s penalty boxes. They hovered around midfield for this game. Brazil, after last time’s debacle, has changed their coach &amp; their usual gameplay. As they try to mimic the Europeans. They dragged up the midfield, lost control of the ball with measured short passes. And had a weird defensive attitude. All that was completely opposite to their natural <em>samba</em> way of dancing around the field. Also, it’s high time people stop idolizing Neymar. And start pointing out the frailty both in his game &amp; in his presence on the field. Along with working on his free-kicks Neymar should spend some time in gym. So that he does not behave like stack of boxes crumbling down with a hint of air around. As a devout fan, I am still not convinced that Brazil is ready to wash off last times’ wounds and that hurts.</p>

    <p>Somehow I could never appreciate use of unnecessary technology in sports. They diminish the charm of human nature &amp; it’s flaws to produce something highly mechanical, predictable &amp; boring. Cricket is already progressing towards such a future of replacing human umpires with robots. Football has avoided such modern luxuries till now. Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>France 2 - Australia 1</strong></p>
<p>Both goals of France were thanks to the technologies - <em>goal-line</em> &amp; <em>VAR</em> which were the only interesting situations of an otherwise boring match. Australians had a highly defensive strategy against an half-hearted France.</p>
<p><strong>Argentina 1 - Iceland 1</strong></p>
<p>Messi’s folks could not breach the <em>sons</em> of Iceland (pun intended). It’s sad to see Messi giving everything &amp; failing in front of the Icelandish giants. Apart from blocking Argentine attack they could also show huge gaps in Argentine defence. These are exactly the kind of games fans like us tune in to the World Cup finals for.</p>
