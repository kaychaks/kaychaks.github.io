<p><em>Oh you can’t</em></p>
<p>Gruber few days back <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/05/safari_vs_chrome_on_the_mac">was praising Safari</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Safari is Apple’s browser for Apple devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it should be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Safari is Apple’s browser for Apple devices <em>to serve Apple’s walled garden interests</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The keynote is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqHdULqet0">available in YouTube</a> so every browser could play it, same keynote in <a href="http://apple.co/2svxHNj">Apple’s website</a> could be streamed in every browser <strong>but</strong> none of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2017/">session videos</a> could be streamed in any browser other than Apple’s own Safari and they are not in YouTube. <em>Any guesses on why such discrepancy !</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/402/">What’s new in Swift</a> session, presenters were talking on some new features geared towards server side Swift. Unfortunately, all those developers who are in Linux using Chrome thinking about using <em>open source</em> Swift for their next system software or server side usage can’t see / listen them.</p>
<p>There is always the option to download SD (min. size 400 MB) / HD (min. size 1.4 GB) videos of sessions, <em>am sure that’ll be a really nice experience.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport">Apple’s support handle</a> in Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/876141756227751936">confused</a> about it and developer forum is <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/237245#237245">mum</a>.</p>

    <p>I am a believer of emails being the right choice for serious conversations (especially when its not live). It makes the writer to think. Today’s situations need, more than ever, ways to keep those conversations hidden <em>(from you know)</em>. PGP is an old, open, and proven choice to get that. And I am a strong believer of the same as well.</p>
<p>However PGP has not got its right share of footing in the world yet. So it has remained as a mean of few (mostly Hackers &amp; Nerds). That should change. For it to happen people familiar with its highs and lows should talk, write and fight. Such conversations only can bring the right change both in thinking &amp; doing.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/12/op-ed-im-giving-up-on-pgp/">Filippo wrote</a> that Signal can replace PGP. And then Bruce Schenier <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/12/giving_up_on_pg.html">backed him</a>. To me the thought sounded a bit strange. But the points raised against PGP are important to note and act upon. As a counter, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/signal-does-not-replace-pgp/">Walkfield wrote</a> a fine piece backing PGP. All of these view points will only help and should happen often.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I will say that <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> is doing their best to spread the love of PGP. <a href="https://keybase.io/kaushikc">I am there</a>. I hope others will join.</p>

    <p>The LambdaConf guys came up with an <a href="http://lambdaconf.us/downloads/documents/lambdaconf_slfp.pdf">interesting way to group Functional Programmers</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LOFP is a standardised progression of different concepts and skills that developers must master on their journey to becoming expert-level functional programmers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too bad it made many developers, especially in Twitter, go mad. It’s not <em>Politically Correct</em> to call anyone by some kind of name these days, that was the biggest worry for most. People also said - most of the stuffs mentioned are really hard, placed in wrong order, will take years to learn, and does not matter.</p>
<p>I don’t agree. To me the note is important for anyone who cares for <em>Functional Thinking</em> and want to have a deep understanding of the same. It has directions to what one should know at each step and how to put use of the same. People must realise - <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SHt7f6BhFjIJ:norvig.com/21-days.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;client=safari">It takes time to know something well</a>.</p>
<p>However, I could think of one small thing to add - the instructions will make more sense for people who are fine with the idea of <em>Typed Functional Programming</em> (oh no!)</p>

    <p><a href="http://joearms.github.io/2016/08/08/Draft-Payment-System-in-Erlang.html">Joe explaining his approach</a> to solve problems while answering a completely different user question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general method for solving all problems is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the most difficult outstanding problem</li>
<li>Solve it</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat this until the only remaining problems are trivial - and you know you can solve them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always liked Joe’s way of explaining things and hence feel <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang">his book</a> is one of the best books introducing a programming language. It’s very much a peek into the mind of the creator rather than just boring language specification laid out on paper.</p>
<p>Later on in this post Joe also mentions where he thinks Erlang is good at, which is really important to note coming from creator himself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Erlang is useless for making GUIs, number crunching and watering flowers. Choose another technology for this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erlang is gaining traction nowadays as the language (or platform) of choice especially to build IoT edge gateways, web servers (thanks Phoenix) &amp; general actor-based distributed systems. Now, the problem with any language coming to mainstream is that people tend to use it for all sort of things. During those times, we should remember what Joe says here.</p>

    <p>When Apple announced about Apple Pay APIs for the web (read Safari), I kind of guessed that it will be different from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/wpwg/2016/04/21/first-public-working-drafts-of-payment-request-api/">Web Payments API standard</a> from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Web Payments Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation of the Apple Pay JS framework talks about bunch of JS events and one session object. Pretty straight forward stuff <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs">with some conditions though</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three requirements for using Apple Pay on your website:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You must have an Apple Developer Account</p></li>
<li><p>Any pages that incorporate Apple Pay must be served over HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p>Your website must comply with the Apple Pay guidelines</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Well so I was right, <em>but not entirely though</em>.</p>
<p>Apple is a member of the aforementioned Web Payments Working Group. And <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-payments-wg/2016Jun/0013.html">they sent a message to the mailing list</a> post the keynote. Following text caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several differences between the Apple Pay API and the Payment Request API, and we look forward using the experience we’ve gained while working on it to help push the Payment Request API forward</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is still some hope of convergence here.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/schedule/#/details/703">tomorrow’s WWDC session</a> on the same and might update this post if some new information comes to light.</p>

    <p>I never understood why is there so much hate in West for Homeopathy. May be it cures via placebo, so what ? It boils down to whom do you trust more. Like the current US election race, it all depends on which bogus mainstream media’s rants one trust.</p>
<p>In case of Homeopathy the choices are - bunch of medical scientists spending large sum of money to prove its fallacy or uncomfortable amount of people here in India who are still alive, because of these what many say “nothing but water”, when their doctors of “modern/researched/approved medicine” have lost all hope (from personal experience(s))</p>

<p>RSS still works. It’s still free. It’s still unfiltered, uncensored and spam-free.</p>

<p>As one of my colleague said in our last podcast<sup id="fnref-1-2016-06-04"><a href="#fn-1-2016-06-04" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> - as knowledge workers, our most important tool is <em>knowledge</em>.

Yes, I co-host a weekly podcast, since last 61 weeks, named “The Tech Show” discussing everything technology from latest trends &amp; fads to in-depth discussions on specific stuffs. Because we refer things happening internal to the organisation, we are not allowed to share it in open (which is sad). But it’s cool and I enjoy doing it.<a href="#fnref-1-2016-06-04" title="return to article"> ↩</a>
